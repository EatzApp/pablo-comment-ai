Excellent food - my highlights were definitely the cheese grits as well as their pasta.
The wings really great too, crunchy texture without being overly salty or greasy.
Food is also reasonably priced for the quantity and quality for the Bay Area.
Be prepared to arrive exactly on time for reservations though, we were not let in earlier until a previous party cancelled.
Excellent spot in the City if you're craving Soul Food!
Cool waiter with spot on recommendations.
I'd recommend the Fried Catfish Cheesy Grits, everything was good though.
My first time having legit soul food and I loved it.
The pasta is incredible, the gumbo is smoky and savoury, but the highlight was the catfish and grits.
The sweet and sour sauce went really well with the cheesy grits.
Beignets were great; highly recommend the chocolate one.
The banana bread pudding was also filling and delicious.
The atmosphere was also great, jazzy music and classy decor.
I really wanted to like the gumbo but there was an almost burnt, nutty taste I couldn't get past.
Other than that the chicken was crunchy and juicy, reasonable price for per piece chicken.
I enjoyed the crab beignet very much and the jelly that comes with the chicken was a great addition.
Staff and vibes are great.
I'd totally be down to try more of their food!
This is one of the best places I've been to in San Francisco.
The watermelon ice tea is beyond amazing.
The food was excellent without any disappointing tastes.
Los Yaquis stands out as one of the premier Mexican cuisine experiences in San Francisco.
A regular customer for the past 16 years since its opening, I've observed its evolution firsthand.
The menu has transformed over time, each change only amplifying its appeal.
From tantalizing seafood dishes to classic Mexican staples, everything is top-notch.
The restaurant's aesthetic, too, has grown with time, now an Instagram-worthy ambiance from every corner.
It's not just about the food and decor, though.
Make your evenings unforgettable by joining their karaoke nights every Friday and Saturday - easily the most entertaining spectacle in town.
The cherry on top?
The cordiality of the staff and owners, always serving with a smile.
I find myself constantly recommending Los Yaquis.
If you're in the city, it's an absolute must-visit!
If you go to Los Yaquis it's a must to order the super mango margarita ü•≠üçπand the food is so delicious!
Everything is so fancy from the food to the drinks and the restaurant it self is so fancy, clean and the waitresses are so sweet!
What I love about this restaurant is when you first walk in their entrance is so beautiful!
Also, I love how they have giant glasses ü•Ç so if you want you can order a GIANT glass of mango ü•≠  margaritas, strawberry üçì margaritas, and more!
Did I mention that this was my first time coming here ?
‚ù§Ô∏èüòçü•∞
VERY delicious Mexican food, nice drinks and great service!
I kind of love this place.
Excellent paella, good service, open on holidays.
I went in here on a whim because it was one of the few places open on Memorial Day.
I got the paella volcanica, and it was a mountain of food plated on a shovel üòç.
The seafood was delicious, especially with the spices and the accompanying salsas.
This is a very tasty place.
Everything I had feel fresh and well served.
The chef Salvador, was outstanding and great host.
I‚Äôm totally going back!
Take out only.
Can understand why in the neighborhood.
Dishes are basic.
No hot peppers with the pho.
At least they were real rice noodles and not bean sprout noodles.
It's so good and inexpensive.
I used to live across the street and this was my go to.
I always get the seafood fried rice which I don't think is even listed on the menu.
And it's the best fried rice ever
Best Chinese food in town, one of my favorites anywhere.
Seriously they could sell this for double or triple the price in a better neighborhood with a functioning dining room and call it 4-Star, and I‚Äôd still pay it.
Food was above par for this price point, but not mind blowing.
This is a standby for a consistent, filling, tasty and economic meal among my friends.
The food is very very low quality even for the prices, they barely will give you any Meat at all, just avoid this place, is not worth your time or money
Went for brunch / lunch on the weekend.
Service was a little slow.
Lot of food options, and I appreciate them having an all-day breakfast menu.
Place has a old-style charm with a grand piano.
I'm sure coming during a piano event is incredible
I need to have a full meal at Max's Opera Cafe and will add to this review after I have done so.
I arrived downtown before a concert I was to attend, realized I was really hungry and stopped in here for a quick bite.
I had a small Caesar Salad that was crisp and fresh.
We had a small wedding ceremony at City Hall and after we walked over to Max's.
Their manager, Sara was so accommodating - we were blown away by the excellent service, reasonable prices and the beautiful space they set for our reception.
Thank you, Max's!!
!
I love Max‚Äôs.
I‚Äôve been going for years.
Went last night and had a great dinner with the lovely piano man playing the piano.
Not something you see a lot of in San Francisco.
They currently have a great Passover menu and a special menu highlighting artichoke and asparagus season.
The must haves from their menu are their famous Reuben sandwich, which is massive, and if you‚Äôre a tuna melt fan, theirs is one of the best I‚Äôve ever had.
My partner had the red wine braised brisket from the Passover menu and it was fantastic.
You can also get a bottle of sparkling wine for a pretty affordable price compared to other restaurants.
The staff is always so friendly.
I love it here.
Menu is huge with a great selection for everyone.
Give Max‚Äôs a try if you‚Äôre in the area!
What an amazing discovery!
We had dinner here before going to a show (we‚Äôre from out of town).
My ruben sandwich was a true experience.
It had LOTS of pastrami AND corned beef on fresh grilled rye.
My wife‚Äôs french dip was also substantial and tasty.
There was no room for dessert, so we came back a second day just for that.
I recommend bringing friends to share the yumminess.
(Tiramisu and Brownie  Mud pie)
Located in the tenderloin, I‚Äôm on a journey to find the best chicken pho.
This spot‚Äôs broth got me nodding my head.
The vibe was specious and the service was quick.
Hoping more people would try this place out.
This place was a yummy hole in the wall, I ordered the chicken pho for only $13.50.
Chopped it up with the owner and got to hear more about their spot.
They opened up a little before the pandemic and it‚Äôs been tough for them, but they‚Äôre still here!
If they could keep one item on their menu, it would be the Combo Pho (Dac Biet).
The resilience of tenderloin and the merchants working there is deep.
Come support local businesses and taste good food at a more than affordable price.
Check ‚Äòem out!
Great service, delicious pho and hu tieu nam vang!
Super flavorful broth and it has a wonderful spacious dine in space too  The banh khot was hot and crispy, definitely try it out!
Pho broth was a little bland otherwise would give it 5 stars.
Pho dac biet portion size was good and very generous with the ingredients.
Lots of tripe!
Quick service in a pleasant atmosphere.
The owners and staff were friendly people.
This food came fast and it was great.
Got Pho Tai Nam it was delicious.
Just had the pho and shrimp pancake at this spot, and it blew my mind ‚Äì it's like Saigon on a plate!
The ingredients are super fresh, the broth is delicious, and the beef is incredibly flavorful.
Plus, they use whole, unfrozen shrimp.
The only downside is that the location...skechy & not safe for parking... Really hope this place sticks around!
WOW!!
Huge portions for a fair price.
Service was amazing.
(I'm assuming) the owner helped me out and was super friendly.
After I sat down, I saw him setting up a plate and sit down for a break...
Mid meal he got up to clear another patrons plate... Never have I seen a service worker stop their break to serve a customer!
What amazing customer service!
My food came out and I was in awe.
This was easily twice what I'd expected!
Could I even eat all of this?
I forced myself and wiped the plate clean with my last bite of bread!
The tzatziki was clearly freshly made, even had one large chunk of garlic clove (yum!!).
2 thumbs up, 1 full belly, and 5+ stars!
Massive portions for the price.
Had the gyro plate.
Probably more than I should eat for lunch.
Would recommend just the gyro unless you're stavting or a big eater.
Food came out unbelievably fast, great for lunch when you're rushed
Gyro King restaurant is a hidden gem that delivers satisfying and flavourful meals.
Their loaded fries are a standout item that takes comfort food to new heights.
With perfectly crispy fries as a base, topped with savory gyro meat, melted cheese, fresh veggies, and a tangy tzatziki sauce, each bite is a burst of deliciousness.
The portion size is generous, leaving you fully satisfied.
The welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff make Gyro King a go-to spot.
Don't miss their mouthwatering loaded fries for a memorable dining experience.
Food and Service was magnificient.
Small business owner with one focus.
Keeping the customet happy.
Exceptional customer service.
Felt welcomed from the moment we entered the place.
Kabobs, rice, gyro, tea, and great deserts.
Make a stop.
5 star service.
Great people, delicious food, clean place!
I messed up and ordered the gyro plate instead of the wrap but enjoyed it anyway!
My visit to 'The Melt' was an unexpected gem on my way to a conference, and it turned out to be a culinary journey I won't soon forget.
The restaurant's ambiance was inviting, and I found myself surrounded by a plethora of alluring options on the menu.
Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I turned to the waiter for guidance, and I must say, it was one of the best decisions of the day.
With a warm smile, the waiter suggested the Sicilian chicken melt burger, assuring me it was a standout choice.
Trusting their recommendation, I dove in, and the burst of flavors was nothing short of mind-blowing.
The succulent chicken paired with the perfect blend of Sicilian-inspired ingredients created a culinary masterpiece that left my taste buds dancing.
What truly elevated the experience was the impeccable service.
The waiter not only guided me to a delightful meal but also exhibited a level of politeness and helpfulness that is often hard to come by.
It was evident that they took pride in ensuring patrons had a memorable dining experience.
As I savor the memory of that delicious meal, I find myself eagerly anticipating a return visit.
The thought of sharing this culinary adventure with my husband before departing from San Francisco adds an extra layer of excitement.
I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in search of a truly delightful dining experience.
When we walked in we were greeted with a big "Welcome!"
from across the restaurant.
The guy manning the register and taking orders was awesome.
It was our first time in and I asked what his favorite dishes are.
He gave excellent recommendations and why.
We took him up on his favorites and were not disappointed!
The restaurant was clean, as were the restrooms.
The food was fantastic!
Will definitely be back!
Nestled in the bustling streets of San Francisco, The Melt offers a dining experience that harmoniously blends comfort food with a touch of gourmet.
On a quest to satisfy my craving for something hearty yet tantalizing, I stumbled upon this gem.
Spoiler alert: it did not disappoint.
The Star of the Show: Jalape√±o Hamburger If there's one thing you take away from this review, it's that The Melt's jalape√±o hamburger is a must-try.
Juicy, perfectly seasoned, and with just the right amount of kick from the jalape√±os, this burger is an absolute delight for anyone who appreciates a little spice in their life.
Each bite is a harmonious blend of flavors that dance on your palate, leaving you wanting more.
Garlic Fries: A Perfect Accompaniment What's a great burger without the perfect side?
The Melt's garlic fries were nothing short of incredible.
Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and infused with the perfect amount of garlic - every fry was a garlicky piece of heaven.
These fries set a high bar and are a testament to how even the simplest dishes, when done right, can stand out.
A dining experience is never just about the food; it's about how you're made to feel during your time at the restaurant.
This is where The Melt truly shines, thanks to its outstanding service.
A special shoutout to Ignacio, who went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was memorable.
His attention to detail, friendliness, and genuine care for our satisfaction were what set this dining experience apart from the rest.
It‚Äôs staff members like him that elevate a meal to an experience.
The Melt in San Francisco is more than just a restaurant; it's a place where comfort food meets excellence, both in flavor and service.
Whether you're a local or just passing through, do yourself a favor and drop by.
Between the mouth-watering jalape√±o hamburger, the addictive garlic fries, and the exemplary service, you‚Äôre in for a treat that your taste buds will thank you for.
I left The Melt with a full stomach, a happy heart, and the certainty that I‚Äôd return.
If you're on the hunt for great American cuisine with a side of impeccable service, look no further than The Melt.
I was in the mood for a grilled cheese, so I came here.
I also got some fries and the strawberry lemonade.
Everything was good.
The grilled cheese was nice and crispy, but I just wish the bread was buttered.
The drink had strawberry chunks, which I wasn't a fan of, but at least they weren't clogging my straw.
Amazing service!!
Always so friendly and inviting.
Definitely a crew you can create a report with.
Security is also always so inviting and welcoming.
Not to mention the food!
Best garlic fries EVER.
And they‚Äôre Mac n Cheese‚Äôs are to DIE FOR.
15/10 WOULD RECOMMEND.
Can‚Äôt go wrong with good food and even better people !
!
!
Absolutely delicious  Yucatecan/Mexican food in my neighborhood!
I love their house made tortillas!
!
Food was absolutely delicious, I got the carnitas torta and had a great time.
The service was amazing and they were very accommodating.
Wow the food here is amazing!
I stopped by on a walk and decided to grab some tacos.
So glad I did.
The chicken street taco is the best taco I have ever had hands down!
The food that I had there was very delicious .
Very tasty ,  the seasonings in their food was very good .
Excellent .
Delicious spot and well-priced.
I got the tacos that used a very tasty tortilla.
I ate a few nice dishes here recently: after ordering, you quickly get the food, usually large portions.
They always had tables available, though take away is also an option.
The menu is rather long, you will probably find all common Thai dishes here.
Although we made reservations, there were still open tables when we arrived at 7:15pm on a Friday night.
The service was so fast.
We ordered a chicken satay as an appetizer, which a few pieces were rubbery.
My husband ordered the Crispy Chicken over Fried Rice, which he loved.
He hoped for more chicken though.
I got the Red Curry with chicken, Garlic and Ginger Rice, and the stir fry broccoli.
The red curry was easily the best dish.
The medium spice was perfect and the crispy eggplants in it.
The garlic rice is a must for garlic lovers.
Although I ate a plate portion, there was still leftovers for 2 servings.
Overall, we‚Äôd definitely come back again.
We recently went to  Lers Ros Thai which serves authentic Thai food.
My Dad recommended it and we were excited to try it out.
The restaurant has a modern and relaxed ambiance with plenty of parking available.
I'm not very adventurous when it comes to trying new dishes, so I usually stick to curries and noodles.
But Lers Ros Thai had some regional dishes on the menu, so I decided to try the Rad Nah.
It had an unexpected mix of flavors - sour, tangy, and a strong seafood taste.
My Dad ordered the Thai Basil with Beef, which he found to be tasty.
My companion had the Pad See Ew with Chicken, and he thought it was good.
The service was satisfactory, but nothing exceptional.
The portions were well-sized for the price, and we even had some leftovers to take home.
Overall, it was a great experience, and I can see why there's so much hype around this place.
Ordered delivery.
- grilled sirloin beef: very greasy.
Not - five spices duck: also very greasy.
Not much flavor either.
- spicy tofu.
Greasy.
Overall: greasy and not very flavorful.
The beef and duck was  over $25.00 each.
Definitely not worth the money.
pretty disappointed.
Ordered takeout.
The Hot and Sour Thai Tom Yum Soup is so fragrant, as soon as I opened the lid the aroma just hit me, and the first sip was absolutely delicious.
Likewise for the Pad See-Ew and Gravy Noodle, just full of flavour.
Clean friendly inside.
Rough hood for real outside.
Busy with big portions everybody was getting.
Salbute and panucho had no crispness but tasty.
Red salsa was tomato sauce paste, no flavor.
The green salsa in squeeze bottle, fiery vinegar bite.
Big burrito was very meaty and good.
Conchita Pibil was flavorful.
Soups were good.
ATTENTION VEGETARIANS!
This is the best-open faced taco value and taste!
It‚Äôs a Panucho Vegetariano and only costs $2.50.
The bottom ‚Äúshell‚Äù is filled with black beans.
Toppings include lettuce, cheese and tomato but also avocado and pickled onions.
Drizzle it in lime!
My only concern was difficulty in knowing how to eat it!
I'm from Mexico and I'd never heard of some of dishes.
They were delicious!!
The tortillas are made by hand and once again the texture and flavor of them were AMAZING.
We brought a pack home to eat later.
Don't do it.
Mother in law almost ate a hair that was on her food.
No one in the kitchen wears hairnets No accountability for their mistakes, they just walk away without saying anything.
Delicious food.
Not worth the price, but it's good.
Try it out, then if you can, make it yourself.
It's good.
I'll keep going back.
Good Value for money!
Happy that I ended up here as the restaurant on other side of street was busy.
Welcoming and amazing customer service.
Very delicious food!
I ordered fried rice with tofu and it was cooked to perfection.
Loved it!
They continued to check if I needed anything else.
Good service.
The Old Siam Thai Restaurant in San Francisco CL is truly among the finest Thai dining spots in town.
My experience with their fried rice and crispy chicken was exceptional, especially noting that it had the best crispy chicken.
If I return to SF, I will undoubtedly revisit this restaurant.
The staff is commendable, and the venue maintains a clean and tidy ambiance.
And they have vegetarian options as well.
Order the lunch combos, taste different dishes with one piece $17.
No need to share what others.
I order soup for $4.
End up I can only eat half of food & save half for dinnerüòã.
This is a hidden gem, one of the best asian restaurants in downtown san francisco.
Their food is authentic.
Love how tasty their Tom Yum soup is.
3 days in SF with 2x eats here üòÄ.
Great food, fast service and pretty relaxing ambience.
Very recommended üëåüèª
Delicious Thai food.
Just like being in Phuket.
Service was very good too.
A nice family run restaurant.
Large enough for groups as well.
The Massiman curry was excellent as well as the pad see ew and the sweet-and-sour coconut soup was also very good.
I ordered the pad kee mow which is my goto at Thai restaurants and theirs was just okay, a little salty, they use slice meats instead of ground which isn‚Äôt that great since it wasn‚Äôt tender, and it wasn‚Äôt spicy or had a strong basil aroma.
Service was good and they have a huge dining area but was mostly empty during lunch time.
This is the best Thai food/experience I've had.
I came in for lunch and was surprised that nobody else was there!
Service was amazing and the food was delicious.
I got the PadThai with a serving of egg rolls and an iced Thai Tea.
Next time I am in San Francisco I will make sure to stop here again!
Amazing authentic well-spiced and aromatic Thai food!
The owners/servers were lovely and very attentive and the large space is like a breath of fresh air.
From the moment Thai Curry Restaurant & Bar opened its doors, it has been nothing short of a culinary revelation.
With its warm and welcoming atmosphere, this hidden gem has quickly become a favorite among the local community, myself included.

Trust me, you'll want to come back time and time again
This is the most authentic D√∂ner I‚Äôve had in SF (I‚Äôve tried many of them)!
It‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôve seen that has the meat on a vertical spit, like they do in T√ºrkiye.
I‚Äôm so happy I came by, the prices are very fair, the restaurant is clean, and the owner is super nice.
I came here twice during the same week to try more items.
The combo gyro on a pita, was exceptional, you can tell that the meat is high quality and cooked perfectly.
The second time I got the Mediterranean combo place which was unreal (lamb, chicken shish kabob, kofte, and both gyro meats), with rice, salad and hummus.
Literally every item tastes good, highly recommend this if you‚Äôre hungry.
Lastly, the Turkish coffee is also great!
I honestly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this spot, you gotta come try it out!
Came in for lunch one day on a pretty nice day.
They had their doors wide open, and didn't have a lot of customers inside.
Order a chicken gyro plate and a drink.
Didn't have to wait very long for the food to come out from the kitchen.
They set down a basket of pizza bread, while we waited for our food.
The food is pretty good.
Portions also pretty good.
There were a lot of to go orders and pick up orders that I noticed.
I think this place may be quite popular around the neighborhood.
The dining area and the bathroom could be a little bit cleaner.
Overall, okay place to drop by for a quick bite.
Murat is very friendly employee food is super delicious i had moist cake and have to ordered another one and baklava is super delicious and have to order for to go will recommend and will come again
Loved this¬†place!
I went to a concert nearby and had some free time before the doors opened and I was craving Mediterranean¬†food.
I found this place and their¬†food is¬†really good.
The highlight were the fries because they¬†were crunchy and so tasty.
The place itself was small and cozy, and the staff were very polite.
The prices were very reasonable¬†for everything on the menu from the looks of it.
On another note, it had a super clean bathroom.
I usually also judge a place based on the cleanliness of the bathroom.
It was even warmed up.
Will try to be back when I am in the city.
My husband and I went to lunch here and was amazed that they had the desert that we liked.
It was called the Turkish delight.
I love it.
The only other place I got was at the Marina.
Anyway, I thought the gyro was OK and the desert was best.
The service was easy and fast.
The restaurant was a little bit older.
Probably will be one of my go-to Chinese delivery places now.
Every dish was solid.
General Tao‚Äôs chicken was specifically tasty.
Have not had egg foo young in little deep fried patties before so that was a bit odd, but it was still yum.
Seafood was generous in the Cantonese chow mein.
Thanks for the free sesame balls that was a nice and fun surprise!
Will be back!
Delicious food, speedy service, and big portions.
I recommend this location for anyone looking for a quick or even a long meal with a friend or family.
The waiter was quick, always checking up on us to make sure we were enjoying our experience.
You're in for a treat if you're looking for authentic food that won't break the bank!
The food at this restaurant is fantastic - you absolutely have to try the fried rice.
Although the service is slow, it's worth it for the attentive staff who are always there to help.
The restaurant gets very busy during lunchtime, so it's no surprise that there might be a delay in getting your food.
But trust us, the wait is worth it for the delicious and affordable cuisine
With the new management, the food has gotten better.
My husband and I have been eating here for many years and always liked the food.
Now, we love the food.
The hot and sour soup is fantastic, the egg rolls are crispy on the outside and yummy on the inside.
The General Tso chicken is even better than before.
And the portions are generous.
Highly recommended.
My recent experience was a bit underwhelming.
I just got off a flight and was very hungry.
The sesame chicken lacked sauce, leaving it dry and plain.
The brown rice was bland and lacked flavor.
Additionally, there was an error in my order, resulting in extra food that I did not request.
While the service was prompt and the staff friendly, the overall dining experience fell short of my expectations.
Improvement in the flavor and consistency of the dishes would greatly enhance the dining experience.
I'm not from the area, so maybe they do thing differently then from what I am use too.
I never leave reviews...and I pulled out halfway through to document my experience.
I had the lamb & beef burger.
It took me back to the beaches of Greece momentarily.
The glasses were chilled, and the service was out of this world.
The owner and bartender are each SF locals that recommended me the best spots in town
I had the beef/lamb hamburger.
When I mentioned I didn't want bread they put it in the most awesome lettuce wrap for me.
The vegetables were beautiful and the taste was magnificent.
I had the house wine it wasn't full body but it sure did pack a punch and was very fruit forward.
The cheesecake looked and tasted marvelous.
Everyone enjoyed their meal.
Great experience and amazing food.
Rami was great and you could tell he took pride in his job!
He explained everything very well and provided an overall positive experience.
Food was some of the best pasta we have ever had.
A little hidden gem!!
The prosciutto pizza was seriously some of the best pizza I've ever had.
The crust had a great cook on it, the sauce was slightly sweet with amazing fresh tomato flavor.
The toppings were simple but divine.
The caramelized onion is the perfect touch!!
The bruschetta was a little crispy for my taste, but that's just a preference thing.
The flavors were spot on.
Highly recommend stopping in here, the food is authentic, fresh, and tasty!
Food was below average with rather ok service.
Not sure if the meals were prepped way well in advance as it did not taste fresh at all.
With this price level there are way better restaurants in the area.
Came here with two other friends on a Monday evening and it wasn't very busy.
Very warm inside.
Our food came pretty quickly.
The 2 orders of garlic naan were great.
We also got the fried eggplant which tasted quite nice (I think even if you don't like eggplant, you could try this dish since it's cooked so softly it tastes like a pumpkin).
Also got chicken tika masala and a saag paneer I think.
Overall enjoyed my experience and could come back.
Enjoy?
Lean, flavorful saag paneer and chicken curry!
The naan wasn‚Äôt great, it wasn‚Äôt fluffy at all, but looking at other photos maybe they were having an off day?
The curries were fantastic, loved that they weren‚Äôt covered in a layer of oil or cream.
The chicken chunks were big and kind of tasted like they were baked in a tandoor.
Medium spicy was very mild.
No wait on Tuesday evening.
Service was fast and good.
Went with the classic chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, rice and naan and left very happy.
Really good price as well!
We were looking for a nice and affordable place to eat in the area and I must say that we were extremely positively surprised!
Very good and rapid service as well as excellent food.
Do not hesitate come here you won‚Äôt regret.
üòä Thanks to the service and cooking staff !
!
Really nice owners.
Kind and warm atmosphere about the whole restaurant.
I came in to pick up a quick late night meal and they kindly included a garlic naan free of charge.
Thanks guys
A great eatery concept for groups or solo.
They offer like a food court concept with three choices of cuisines to choose from: Indian,Vietnamese, and Japanese!
Good food and colorful atmosphere!
It's like a Poke place but they have three types of cuisines.
The Japanese one is pretty much standard poke, then there are Vietnamese and Indian fare served in a Poke style.
Price is pretty standard and I frequent this place quite a lot.
Cool concept!
There are 3 stations (Indian, Vietnamese, Japanese) each with the same layout and pricing.
You can order from the menu or do a "rice bowl" and pick your own toppings.
Everything looked tasty.
Large portions at fair prices.
Lots of seating inside plus a large fenced-in outdoor patio in the back.
Great environment to enjoy some sun and eat lunch.
I wish it were open for dinner, but there's not much else around, so maybe there's simply not enough demand then.
I'll be back for lunch!
I've had the Indian paneer salad and the Vietnamese sesame beef salad and both were delicious!
And they have a great patio to enjoy it on.
I will definitely return to try other menu items.
Great selection of healthy Asian food.
I like that they have "lite" options for smaller portion.
Healthy and delicious!
I loved this place!
I ordered the B.B.Q.
Beef Short Ribs and they came with sweet and spicy sauces, incredibly savory!!
And the Thai Iced Tea was so delicious!!
The whole restaurant looked very welcoming and calm but everyone was happy.
Amazing experience üòã
I got the pineapple chicken fried rice and it was an absolute treat.
Underneath that rice was plenty of meat, cashews, onions, and pineapple.
They also serve soda in a chilled mug!
The atmosphere is cozy and the waiter was swift and personable.
No complaints.
We really liked the Thai food here.
The restaurant is not very spacey which we liked.
It is more comfortable and more privat.
The food was really tasty and big portions, with a lovely decoration.
We stopped by Million Thai for lunch before a matinee show at the Curran Theater.
The menu had a good and fairly standard selection of dishes.
The yellow curry was DELICIOUS - a lovely depth of flavor and nicely spiced without being spicy.
Their Thai Iced Tea was also delicious (and most unexpected in SF, served with a plastic straw, thankfully).
The server was very friendly and personable.
We'd definitely come back again for future shows at the Curran.
Really good Pad Thai.
Super friendly service.
Sad to see it was completely empty on a Saturday night, but take out was really quick
Wow, I have been eating sushi for 35 years and this is the third place where I was ever truly surprised and delighted.
While I am not a real officionado I can say for certain that all the boxes got a check mark.
Food, atmosphere, and staff were not just wonderful but really a cut above my expectations.
I‚Äôve never had makerel that was so mild but still flavorful.
We had a type of poke salad with mixed fish and mixed greens and pickled veg that was fantastic.
The atmosphere, the ambiance, the art, the lighting, the architecture is pretty darn cool as somebody found a way to integrate the dated and rustic concrete building which was likely a auto garage or something back in the day, with a sweet room modern vibe.
The caterpillar roll looked like a damn caterpillar and the dynamite roll was the best I‚Äôve had.
I hope I‚Äôm not being dramatic.
My sushi experiences range from Monterey, Seaside, Marin, SF, Santa Cruz, and Portland.
Never been to Japan but after this sushi I ran home and started to research trips to Japan as I was inspired.
Don‚Äôt let the name for you.
This place has high level, incredibly flavorful sushi I highly recommend the Omakase plate with A5 Wagyu beef.
Great service very attentive.
Perfectly prepared and served.
Don‚Äôt miss out on a great experience if you‚Äôre in SF.
Truly a hidden gem - amazing, amazing food, kind staff and honestly it‚Äôs just really beautifully decorated!
This is our favorite place to take friends and quickly became a go-to.
Cute sushi place.
When i entered off a quiet street in SF I felt like i was walking into a speak-easy‚Ä¶a secret off the beaten path kind of place.
5/5 Fresh tasty sushi.
we enjoyed the The Sunflower roll was our favorite.
Our first time trying mango in a sushi roll!
5/5 Good menu 4/5 Good ambiance.
Quiet though as we had an early reservation.
5/5 Good service.
5/5 Safe easy street parking.
Thats something to say these days for San Francisco
I had an exceptional ramen experience at Eat Sushi Restaurant .
The Ramen broth was incredibly rich and flavorful, the noodles were cooked to perfection, The presentation was simple yet appetizing, and the friendly service added to the overall positive experience.
Highly recommended!
The most authentic Thai food I've seen in California.
Prices are reasonable and the service is fine.
I love the shrimp paste fried rice and beef noodle soup.
It is in the heart of tenderloin so the location can be a problem.
Been here a few times and was always happy with the experience.
A Vietnamese friend introduced me to the place and we always come here for our Thai food fix.
We especially like their pork fried rice, crispy fish and pad see ew.
Every new thing we try gets added to that list plus all the regular offerings like Pad Thai, etc.
It's a small mom and pop shop you wouldn't know was there unless you specifically looked for it.
It's clean, albeit can use a fresh coat of paint.
But that's not what you would go here for.
The service is good and the staff are friendly.
I always give them a thumbs up.
We walked for 15 minutes just to try their food and it really satisfied our cravings!
Tom yum soup is the bomb!
Pad Thai tastes incredible!
The serving was fast too.
Authentic Thai food üòã Fried rice is not too oily.
Just the right asian fried rice.
We will surely come back to this place!
Coming from a Thai person: this is the most authentic Thai spot I‚Äôve tried in SF so far!
It‚Äôs a no-frills, hole in the wall vibe, so don‚Äôt expect too much in the way of ambience, but the food is amazing and the servers are really friendly.
They have a large variety of Thai food as per usual, but highlights are the grilled pork neck and som tum (pappaya salad), which taste exactly like they do back home.
Their crispy pork belly with chinese broccoli is also amazing, the pork belly is perfectly crunchy and so well seasoned.
Beef noodle soup was hearty and umami and so comforting!!
Really generous servings as well.
This is my new go-to spot for Thai food!
Went in when it was pretty empty so I was expecting a decently delicious meal but sadly all  I got was this under seasoned chicken over rice.
Rice was good but the chicken was lacking any type of seasoning it was beyond bland and on top of that the bell pepper were raw and burnt at the same time.
Would not recommend!
Staff were very condescending too they seemed  very annoyed to even take my order.
One of the best dinner places with shareable plates for everyone!
We booked this place since we a local concert to watch in the late evening.
The inside layout is amazing cozy and perfect for a date night.
They even have a wine room with shelves and rows of wine, quite the look!
We sat down and got a couple drinks, I ordered an old fashioned and it was delicious, they really know how to make their drinks!
We ordered a handful of dishes, appetizers, mains, and some pasta.
There were so many items that looked amazing it was tough to say no to any of them.
Their plates come out in shareable sizes and are perfect, a little taste of everything and that a perfect way to eat dinner.
Everything tasted phenomenal and I truly mean phenomenal.
The service was great, they were always attentive and took care of us every step of the way.
We even finished with a little bit of desert.
A perfect date night.
Check this place out, it‚Äôs an experience you won‚Äôt forget!
The food was good and the ambiance was great.
The reason why my outing didn't get 5 stars is because our server seemed to forget about us about halfway through our dining experience.
They had great attention to detail at the beginning of the night, as I went for my birthday and they had placed a thoughtful celebratory card on our table.
That attention seemed to go out the window about 45 min into our experience.
My friend and I ordered a couple drinks and five food dishes - a starter, a pasta dish, two main entr√©es, and a veggie side.
The drinks, starter, and pasta came out no problem.
But everything afterwards took quite a while.
Our server mentioned once that there was a little bit of a delay with the mains, but didn't check in or ask if we wanted to order another round of drinks despite being out for at least 15 min.
When we did finally get her attention, she put in our second drink order, but we didn't get it until after our mains had arrived, we'd finished our meal and were already paying the check (she actually forgot to bring it and was going to send us on our way after paying the bill, so we had to ask twice).
Better, more consistent service throughout could've made it a perfect experience.
This was quite possibly the best serviced meal I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of eating.
And the food was incredible.
We ate family styled and tried so many dishes.
The highlights for me were the porkchop, the sourdough bread with truffle butter and bone marrow gravy, and the gnocchi.
We also had the tomahawk steak, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and squid ink pasta.
For dessert the upside down cake was excellent.
The cocktail to try is the self titled Otium.
Its light citrus flavor with Japanese whisky was perfect.
I was really disappointed.
I came here before for a corporate event and was impressed with the food and atmosphere.
This time, I brought wife on a date.
There were only a few customers when we arrived after visiting The Broad.
After we ordered and sat down, her food came and then mine came over 5 minutes later.
She's a lady, so she didn't eat until mine came, so her food was getting cool.
My eggs benadict was the worst I remember having anywhere- sweet jam and fatty ham were NOT good ingredients.
Her hammock hash had a lot of cream fresh that made the potatoes soggy.
Our Bloody Mary's were the best part- but they had sweet pickles (who does that?)
The atmosphere is really nice and the service was good.
My date and I had a good time in a beautiful setting, despite the poor food.
Had a chance to try out new drinks, new style of food and a great ambience.
Fish neck with rice, whole prawn(perfectly cooked) with naan bread, Japanese whiskey and a Japanese whiskey cocktail.
Modern take on Mediterranean food.
I got a Berliner wrap, and I wish there was more meat.
The wrap itself is substantial but it felt small eating it all.
I was hoping for it to be bigger because whenever I make a wrap with other Mediterranean joints, my wrap is huge and overflowing with food for a fraction of a price that they sell here at Spitz.
The cashier was nice and the atmosphere is intimate.
A little too dark for my liking though.
It almost looks closed from the outside.
This is a good meet up joint though.
The Berliner was my favorite.
Didn‚Äôt like the Doner basket as much as the Berliner but it was still filling for the price.
The Doner basket has everything in it and I thought it‚Äôd be more my speed but was just ok.
Gives me lunch vibes or something quick vibes.
Bartender was delightful, food came out fast and feels healthy.
The beef-lamb meat is flavorful.
Didn‚Äôt like the falafel.
Strong and unique drinks.
I‚Äôd recommend this place for a quick bite.
$15 Flat rate parking garage near by.
They should validate parking
Food was good for the price.
L it was just bland for me and the wraps could use little more sauce.
The ambience was good and service was fast.
First time here.
My son and I had lunch.
Cooks and waiters were friendly, the place was clean, love that they have self serve water and doggie bag items available++ and the food was delicious!
Had the Remix bowl with beef and lamb; their lemon dressing sauce was amazing!
My son had the Berliner bowl They had three different sangrias available my son had the white sangria and he said it was good.
Nice music, people, and space to eat outside if you like.
I would definitely come back here.
Wrap and fries were good.
Churros were ok, I like my drink to
Ripped me off 11$ on my gift card.
Don't ever go there.
Not exactly the friendliest place, nor is anything particularly appetizing.
It seems a bit run-down, kind of dirty but they seem to be trying their best, especially considering their challenging location.
Among my order, there was a needless - and opportunistic!
- markup on the drinks.
I bought a snickers on the way out and ate it later: the thing was old and stale!
I didn't exactly leave with a good impression overall.
Like a small business like this, people like me want to route for you, but please respect the needs of your customers.
And please charge fairly and when you can, make sure that what you have on the shelf is not expired and of some edible quality.
Don‚Äôt be sketched out by the location.
Tacos were absolutely delicious and 10/10 service
Love this place to eat a nice beans,egg and steak breakfast.
Honestly, don't let the grittiness of the outside appearance of the walk into the place keep you or deter you from this very specially cooked food.
The love and culture is detected in every bite.
Soon you'll realize how worth it the trip was to eat there.
Very honest and down to earth staff.
Mexican food, some American food dishes, snacks, drinks.
Right off the corner of Maple & 6th.
Enjoy.
Tell them David Leyva sent you.
I love this place because it's so close to where I work.
It is a total hole in the wall.
No wait when I got there.
Nice staff asked me a bunch of times because they wanted to get my order just the way I wanted it.
Food is great.
If you are going to Walt Disney Concert Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavillion, Zipper Concert Hall, The Museum of Contemporary Art, and The Borad Museum, you should stop by Vespaio.
They served delicious Italian cuisine and modern envience.
I ordered Beet Salad, Pea Soup, Sea bass, and Garganelli.
We came here after a show because it was conveniently located near the venue and we liked the vibe of the place.
We got the fried calamari and focaccia bread as appetizers, beet soup, and risotto with filet mignon au jus.
Everything was good except the beet soup.
To be fair, I had never had beet soup before and did not expect it to be sweet.
Luckily the focaccia and calamari filled me up and satisfied me.
My husband loved his risotto with filet mignon.
The service was also good.
The food is a little pricey, but I would still consider going back to try other menu items because of its conevient location near The Broad, MOCA, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The food was OK.
Somewhat pricey for very average pasta dishes.
Not sure if my expectations were high or Italian pasta can sometimes be overrated for what it is.
I've been to some very good Italian restaurants where they also have in house made pastas, and the execution was great, the ingredients creative.
Here it was just OK.  Not blowing anyone's mind though tastewise.
Had a lobster pasta, the Potato Topini, which was a bit average.
Also a guanciale (similar to pancetta, but cheek) wrapped scallop over polenta squares--not sure that's the best way to serve polenta or scallops.
Kind of an odd texture combo.
The service was very good.
The servers very attentive.
The setting was also sophisticated as its in the middle of downtown LA among the sleek skyscrapers, by a grassy courtyard with olive trees, and across from the busy Broad Museum.
There's a lot of great food dining options around DTLA.
Problem is choosing the right option for the time.
I randomly came in here on a Saturday, not knowing what to expect.
I ended up finding the best dine in experience of my life.
The food was amazing, the staff was very friendly and professional.
I've never had Italian food this good.
The well kept dining area was beautiful.
I 100% recommend.
Stopped in for dinner before we caught ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù next door, and man‚Äî we couldn‚Äôt have picked a better spot.
Service is terrific, the space is airy and cozy, and the food is just excellent.
Creative specials, fresh ingredients, all prepared to perfection.
The cocktails were great too!
Prices were right about what you‚Äôd expect for the area, but you sure do get what you pay for.
I‚Äôd love to come back the next time I‚Äôm in the area.
I loved everything about the place the atmosphere was great with the light post inside and the lights going around making me feel like I'm outside and loved the burrito mojado not only did it look great It tasted great.
But the thing I loved the most was the horchata it's one of the best I've tasted.
Most I've had aren't that sweet or just taste more like water, but this was just right.
The flan was good, not much to say about it, just taste like the others I've had.
The service was ok, food was late (but still warm).
The downside is a regular Agua Fresca or drink is $6, no refills and they don't refill to the top.
Basically if you're not Caucasian they don't attend you at a 100%.
We randomly stopped at El Paseo Inn after strolling Olvera Street.
We decided to sit at the outside patio area since the inside was a little dim.
They had these cute hanging lights on top.
One thing we noticed was that the tables are on a slant.
We tried‚Ä¶ - Chile Verde; the braised pork was a little dry.
The spicy verde sauce was okay and not very spicy.
The corn tortillas are made in house.
- Camacho‚Äôs Tacos; Carne Asada was flavorful.
Liked the red sauce!
Rice and beans were okay.
- Small guacamole; very good ü•ë - Chips and salsa; crunchy and tasty  Overall, the food was okay.
Although the servers were helpful, they weren‚Äôt the friendliest.
I recently dined at El Paseo Inn, and I was blown away by the entire experience.
The warm and inviting ambiance immediately transported me to Mexico.
The dimmed lights, rustic decor, and lively music created the perfect atmosphere for a memorable evening.
The service was impeccable from start to finish.
The staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, guiding us through their extensive selection of dishes.
They ensured our drinks were never empty and even surprised us with a complimentary appetizer, which showcased their commitment to customer satisfaction.
Now, let's talk about the food.
Each dish was a work of art, bursting with authentic Mexican flavors.
The guacamole was freshly made at our table, and the tacos were a delightful explosion of tastes and textures.
I can't forget to mention their mole sauce; it was heavenly.
Overall, this restaurant goes above and beyond in every aspect.
It's a must-visit for anyone who appreciates exceptional Mexican cuisine served in a delightful ambiance, with top-notch service.
I went with my family and we had a lovely time, the service was excellent all the staff were so friendly.
I made a HUGE mistake I didn‚Äôt order enchiladas de mole!!
And I try a little bit and was delicious, I can say is the best mole that I ever ate!
I got a alb√≥ndigas soup or was good but after that bite of mole I was sad lol.
Sorry for the pictures It was too late
Got 2 tacos of carnitas this what they gave me.
I had to pay $2 for the little plate of chips and got a Topo Chico hard seltzer for $9.12 all together $20 good was ok I ate it cause I was hungry.
Service there wasn‚Äôt any and as for atmosphere it old not vibrant and modern.
We went to LA Luz del Dia restaurant on a weed day for lunch.
We had the carnitas tacos plate with rice, beans, and salsa.
The food was served on a paper plate (which I personally did not appreciate) but the food was cooked to perfection and was excellent!
The establishment (including the restrooms were spotless) We are definitely coming back here again in the future!
So the food was ok, we ate inside they did not ask for our covid card and ID to sit inside (and that did become required 3 days ago).
The lady cutting the pork did not use gloves and was peeling the meat apart to put it in the taco shells (yes at this point we should of walked out).
But with all the great reviews we really wanted to try it.
The ladies did get a little attitude when we didn't want 2 of the shells cause of lent being on it then we didn't  want slaw on it just lettuce and cheese and that irritated her (I think we just had a little language barrier, and we apologized for that).
I did not observe no one washing hands in-between drinking etc and making more tacos.
The lady cleaning tables kept filling her cup up.
When asked about refill they do not give you one but you can pay full price for another fountain drink (that would only cost maybe 5cents in syrup)  But they will give you a cup of ice for free, seems ridiculous.
Not worth going back.
Check out the ones by the vendors selling stuff.
These ladies are not friendly
Classic Olveria Street place to grab tasteful Mexican food with handmade tortillas.
I tried their pina agua Fresca which was perfect.
My mom came her as a kid, and it's a great place to continue a simple Olveria Street tradition.
My favorite place to eat in LA!
The food is always fresh and delicious.
I‚Äôve been coming here for over 20 years and it has stayed consistent - welcoming with amazing food.
I highly recommend the carnitas plate though you can‚Äôt go wrong with anything you pick.
If you need something sweet, don‚Äôt forget to try the jamaica.
Came here on a random weekday night and was blown away by the food.
Unassuming restaurant with a surprisingly spacious and clean interior.
Open late with nearby street parking.
Perfect place to grab dinner with a group.
Service was quick and friendly.
The salted fried tofu were tasty bites, and the Singapore noodles were absolutely fantastic.
The prices were fair too.
Everything hit the mark!
Highly recommend and will definitely be back.
One of the highly rated Chinese restaurant in the LA area, coming here with some friends to check it out.
Some of the dishes we ordered that we loved and would highly recommend are: Shrimp and asparagus, Mongolian beef, and the one dish that I‚Äôve never seen on a Chinese menu before was 7 flavor lamb chops, what a unique and delicious dish, I would highly recommend.
No wonder this place has the highest rating on yelp.
Give it a try you‚Äôll love it too.
Great late night Chinese food, 11pm in DTLA Chinatown.
Very good food preparation and presentation.
I ordered my staples:  yang chow fried rice, short ribs and wonton soup.
Serving size is fair.
Price is good too.
Free parking at night.
Recommended.
In the heart of downtown Chinatown.
Fairly priced food , convenient and very quick to serve.
Highly recommended
Came here for a late night dinner.
My friend and I shared the fried calamari, Singapore Style Noodles, and Black Pepper Beef Mignon #40.
Great portions were served.
Everything tasted delicious ü§§.
We were also served tea, without even asking for it!
The staff were very friendly as well.
Definitely recommend trying this place out.
A serving enough for two meals for the price of $10, definitely coming here again :)
Place is located on a corner, hard for parking but I got lucky.
Service was fast and great.
The lady was helpful and friendly.
The food not so great.
Each plate was about $8 or 9.
I got the noodles and two sides which were the chicken& broccoli and orange chicken.
Both sides tasted old and didn't taste good.
The noodles didn't have much flavor either.
The food looks better than it taste.
Update: My partner and I both feel EXTREMELY sick from the food.
STAY AWAY.
Changed my review to one star.
I would give it zero!
Food was really good!
I just walked in told him what I wanted and he served it in a giant Styrofoam box the portions are out of this world!
Took less than 5 minutes
Receptionist was very nice.
The food is just terrible.
The chicken in super dry.
I smelled the food up the block and i was excited.
Unfortunately there isn't a lick of flavor in it.
The food is prepared daily and yummy!
We like the noodles, fried chicken and beef broccoli.
They will serve white rice if you ask.
I want to take a moment to thank Miguel and the team for saving my lunch presentation with clients today.
They were already very busy with lunch orders and were still happy to help me with my 11-person last minute order.
Food was delicious!
While I‚Äôm going to ding them for not having chocolate chip cookies ready üòú, I‚Äôm still going to HIGHLY recommend them for your future lunch needs.
Fun lemonade-based drinks.
The staff are attentive and efficient.
If you're unsure of an order, you can ask to sample a few of the lemonade flavors.
You can mix some of the flavors.
I got the lavender elderflower lemonade mixed with some plain green tea to cut the sweetness.
Counter service restaurant.
Food was tasteful but lukewarm at best.
I wish they were a bit warmer, especially for the salmon bowl.
Room temperature food just makes it feel like the food was sitting around for awhile.
The carrot and ginger lemonade was delicious.
Serving sizes for the food and drinks were good.
Light and delicious meals.
My meal came out to $21-24(?)
which was two sides, a protein and rice.
I got the Mexican street corn and mash potatoes (very tasty) with the grilled chicken (tender but a bit bland) with the spicy piri sauce.
The sauce brought everything together.
I don‚Äôt remember the exact price as I paid with cash.
I got their classic lemonade and it was very good.
Definitely recommend giving this place a try.
I was on a model job and they provided lunches from this place , and I got the vegetarian  box that had cauliflower in it , amazing üëèüèæ  because it was curry cauliflower mixed with cranberries and nuts , I have never personally went to this place but now I plan to go
A Japanese food restaurant and generally quite good and gives a generous portion too.
I ordered creamy salmon roll and it taste pretty good!
But I feel weird this place selling Japanese food but not offering green tea at all.
üòâ  Place is kinda small and most tables probably cater for 2 pax only.
Will be a challenge if you in a family of 4.
All in all, good food at decent price.
Was it memorable?
Well maybe for me as it was my first time visiting LA but it was the occasion and not because of the food which wows me.
Will I order again?
I think no but if all the food shops closes down already and this is the only shop available then yeah, I guess I might consider ordering from here.
I kept watching people go in and out of this restaurant as I sit in the plaza, so I thought they must have good food... Maybe they do, but certainly not what I purchased that day.
The salmon sushi w/ crab was VERY fishy smelling, the grilled salmon was overcooked, with a small tired looking bunch of mixed vegetables, and the spicy tuna had something else that I had to pick out.
2 sushi rolls and a lunch for $30.
Better try the meat or chicken.
Decent lunch spot.
Not too many options on this side of downtown.
The teriyaki chicken or orange chicken bowls are good lunch deals.
The sushi rolls are ok too.
Went here after school twice, with my brother and we liked it, the pork ramen is good, I also really liked the tiger roll.
Everything on the menu looks delicious.
I had the chicken noodle soup with bean sprout.
It was tasty, fresh and affordable.
The young lady who took my order was polite and served my meal with napkins, utensils and condiments without me having to ask.
It took about 10 minutes to get my soup ready and in total I paid 18 dollars for the soup, a canned soda, a 16 oz.water bottle, and the tip.
For my next visit, I plan on getting the dragon roll.
Authentic Mexican food,  reasonable price.
This humble and cozy Mexican restaurant,  it is located very close to the corner of 7th street and Main street.
Parking is certainly not easy to find and the neighborhood is close to fashion district.
However,  the food was authentic and fresh made,  not coming out of warmer s, as you would find them in the Central Market.
I ordered a bowl of beef soup.
It was very hot and clear, tasted like homemade and delicious.
There were five pieces of chunky beef, a little tough but still chewable.
The restaurant was simple and colorful,  feels cozy and warm.
However,  the rest room was really lacking of regular maintenance,  such as no toilet paper and seat covers.
Plus,  since there is no parking for bicycles outside of the restaurant,  so the staff had to push in and out of bicycles often, to do the food delivery, right inside of the restaurant and passing your dining tables.
When it comes to food,  I certainly will come back to this restaurant again.
I looked for Shrimp Cocktail in our area.
I found it here at Alebrijes!
Not only do they have it, but they make it just like i do.
They pack the cocktail glass full of shrimp and Veggies.
Theres the right ratio of juice and flavors to go with it.
Cocktail comes with side of crackers and lemon.
They bring hot sauce and ketchup to the table.
The gentleman brought chips and salsa as well ü§© I enjoyed the flowers and candy skulls on the table.
So cute!
Its quite a Small place, but it can get packed.
The food is great.
I do recommend if you get the nachos to add and order Guacamole or avacado extra cheese üßÄ for the nachos.
They serve alot.
They're not stingy.
Love that they have good portion sizes!
We tried their hardshell taco so yummy!
I had a papa taco.
It was very crispy üëå Also a asada taco that hit the spot.
He had a Shrimp & rice burrito.
ü•≤i wish i ordered that.
It was amazing with the chile that came with the chips.
I had 99% enjoyed my food.
That 1% wished my nachos werent as dry.
Maybe I'll  ask for extra cheese next time.
ü§î or salsa on top.
That might taste even yummier.
Its not their fault.
Im really picky with my Nachos.üòÜwhat i love is that i have the option to put the sauce on in the first place.
üòÜ The cooks are awesome here!
They're; fast, cook well done, friendly, and find the way to serve to the table even with the amount of orders that pour in.
*Inside is family friendly But outside is a hit or miss when it comes to the atmosphere.
It's near a busy corner.
They usually have the Tv on to sports or game shows when i eat there.
It reminds me of Eating at my Grandpas house.
üòÅ I love it.
My adventures to find the best Shrimp Cocktail in L.A is still on.
Even though this one is so far the BEST in downtown.
ü•∞ Thank you guys for keeping the cup full of Shrimp & veggies with the perfect amount of juice ‚ù§Ô∏è  thank you for always cooking with the right flavor!
I had walked past this place previously and decided to try it out one day.
Man was I blown away!
The food was much better than I expected!
And the drinks as well, pleasantly surprised.
Parking is awful in DTLA and this is within the Skid Row/Flower District area.
Despite the area, this is mos def a spot.
Highly recommended if you want to try it out.
Two words, delicious and amazing.
One of the best downtown Los Angeles Mexican grill restaurant.
I loved every bit of the experience.
So disappointed with the menudo thought they served me a good amount but it was the huge pork leg that they added and hardly any menudo and they don‚Äôt add hominy
Cheese tamales and potato tacos al fresco.
Odd phrasing, but nothing awkward about eating this great meal while standing outside watching the nearby festivities celebrating Mexican Independence Day.
Fresh ingredients and an expert touch make the simplest foods a dream come true.
Speedy and friendly service here too.
Authentic little restaurant on Oliva Street,  a block away from Union Station.
Loved it and the area.
I've forgotten to writing it down, I've been eating there for once a month and years ever since in 1993s, There's been very little luxury place where they're workin' hard to making feed to theirs customers be happy and cleaned place.
I've eats really good deliciously it.
Excellent food.
Opens early!
Food is decent and service is pleasant.
It‚Äôs on the inside of of the Olvera St. walk.
On this street with many choices this place puts out consistent fare at a reasonable price.
Tried some chilaquiles and did not disappoint.
It‚Äôs in a nice little space and some counter spots too.
It does get busy and might be a wait.
This is a walk only street and plenty of parking choices nearby or public transit.
Recommend if in this area.
Really yummy.
I got the birria plate along with some chips.
The salsas at the table were delicious.
No complaints.
Our server didn't speak english, but that's okay, just something to note and be prepared for.
If you want to eat thoughtful and delicious Thai food, and you happen to be near downtown LA‚Ä¶ this is the place to go.
I stumbled into here during a rainy day with a friend and was so surprised how elegant the place and service feels.
On top of that the food was delicious, especially their Tofu Tom Yum and mango sticky rice :)
Our family took a little day trip to downtown LA so we stopped by to try White Elephant in the Spring Arcade building.
Parking was a little crazy that day because there was a cycling event going on, but we were able to find a spot a few blocks down and enjoy a stroll.
We were greeted and seated right away, and the staff were so attentive in answering our questions about the menu and making recommendations.
We love how they take traditional Thai flavors and add a modern twist, creating unique and beautiful dishes that delight the palate.
We tried:  Truffle Ong Potato Confit Enoki Mushroom Crisps Papaya Salad Panang Curry w/ Pork Belly Drunken Noodles w/ Seafood Coconut Fried Chicken w/ Crispy Kale Fried Ice Cream Longan Juice Ube Thai Coffee Sweet Cream Green Tea  We absolutely loved everything we tried!
We got it all at a medium level spice, and we were very happy with the flavor explosion in each dish.
My favorite was the non-spicy coconut fried chicken - the crunch and flavor of the batter, combined with the modern twist of the kale with goat cheese salad...ü§§ I would definitely go back for this.
And you don't wanna pass up the Ong Potato Confit either- you won't find this anywhere else!
Must try: Bulgogi potstickers, mango blue sticky rice.
we loved all the dishes we had, service is outstanding and the place is so nice and clean for a pleasant dine-in experience
I am a fan of good Thai food and this place definitely reckons that.
Tucked up in a mall like place full of eateries , it boasts authentic flavors and definitely a gourmet dining experience.
Talking about service, the staff goes above and beyond to answer any questions you have and provide the beat suggestions according to your palate.
Lets talk about the food , I got the Mushroom crisps which were bit on oily side but boy they were yummy and crisp as it could be!
Salmon belly  tartare is really exquisite , it has got a lot going on in there and just explodes flavors in your mouth!
For the mains, I got Panang curry with  chicken and Thai fried rice with seafood.
One thing to note is the quality of ingredients is very high, you can tell when you taste it!
I loved the Panang, its a curry that I always order whenever I am in a Thai eatery and its a must here!!
The quantity and quality is enough for a party of two or three!
I admired the patio ambiance, gives you a rustic vibe.
I can't wait to come back for more!
Happy eating.
PS - They also have bottomless Mimosas going on here ;) More on IG @whatscookinginla
Ya know i Love this place.
Lately I've been resting after work.
I love to cook my own food, but when i eat out i choose my Restaurants wisely.
White Elephant üêò  Never fails me, since day 1 I've  been a fan.
(Anticipated it before it even opened downtown. )
Was very honored to have 2 Sweet Cream Green Teas!!
Thank You So very Much ü•∞ they were so very Delicious!
I ordered my usual Basil chicken.
I love crunching on the Basil üòÖ something about it is so satisfying üòå.
Ya know, everytime i eat here the flavor gets more and more Intense  with goodness!
Keep up the great work White Elephant!
üëç Cheers to the Best meals ever.
ü•∞üòçü§©
Had an asada Huarache here for the second time.
It was soooo good.
Omg!
heavenly!.
Home-made deliciousness is a specialty here.. everything on the menu far exceeds my palettes expectations.
Ive had a few things in this menu and personally I've never been disappointed.
If you're ever around and hungry for authentic Mexican.
This hole in the wall will definitely surprise you.
Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!
Highly recommend!!!!
I loved the green chilaquiles.
Spectacular!
edit: I returned recently and it was not as good as the first time ): ....
The portions were generous, ensuring I left the restaurant with a happy, satisfied belly.
The friendly and attentive staff made the experience even more enjoyable, providing excellent service throughout my visit.
You know what?
It‚Äôs a little hole in the wall place.
Why do I give the atmosphere 5 stars?
Because it‚Äôs not trying to be something it‚Äôs not.
Good little family place.
So far I‚Äôve really liked everything I‚Äôve gotten there.
A nice place to be.
Only need to update some details and also verify the profile on Google you can WhatsApp me for your business profile verification in order for your business to be visible to search engines and get more customers
This place is so beautiful, the workers were super nice and were always attentive.
The decorations inside the restaurant are very festive and colorful.
The food was amazing ü§© very delicious.
11/10 recommend !üòã
This restaurant is very authentic and the food is amazing.
The owners show a lot of pride!
Our first time here and we can't wait to come back!!!
I highly recommend the beef fajitas and the chicken mole!
I love this place.Amazing food!
Spicy and fresh.
The side dish mole was so good.
Superb and friendly service.
Hidden gem in the middle of Chinatown!
When you want something different other than wonton soup (which I LOVE) or dumplings (them too!)
while you're visiting Chinatown, then come to Los Compadres!
Gairo, the owner, is very hospitable and gracious.
He informed us that he recently opened 3 months ago and that he is in the process of retaining an ABC license to serve alcohol.
The chips are made fresh, and the salsa is divine and unique.
We ordered the asada quesadilla with rice and beans and the cheese enchiladas.
They were both delicious!!!
You can choose green or red sauce for the enchiladas.
I chose red and man, was it good!
A little spicy and topped with queso fresco.
The rice is light and fluffy, and the beans are just like mommas!
The quesadilla is made with large,  FRESH home-made tortillas.
I've NEVER had a quesadilla this good... no lie!
The bottom line is that this is my new favorite Quaxacan restaurant, and you all need to go visit and support this new establishment.
You can thank me later!
üòâüëç
Hidden gem in DTLA and undoubtedly the best Mexican food I‚Äôve had in this city.
This spot is relatively new and in an assuming strip mall in Chinatown, but what it may lack in prime location, it certainly makes up for in the quality of food.
Everything we ate from the salsas to the entrees (we got the enchiladas with mole and the sopes) was absolutely delicious.
After dining at close to 100 Mexican restaurants throughout Southern California and southern Arizona, I can say with absolute certainty that this spot is number one.
The mole is a must, whether you get it over enchiladas or chicken, and the pastor is up there too.
The handmade tortillas and salsa verde were also highlights.
The owner is nice and accommodating making for a very welcoming atmosphere.
Check this place out before people start flocking here.
I visited here to celebrate my birthday.
Despite not making any reservations, I easily got a table around 4 PM on a weekday without waiting.
The seat I got was near the pizza oven, which made it uncomfortably hot and far from an enjoyable dining experience.
I had the onion soup as a starter, which was delicious, especially the part baked with cheese on top.
For the main course, I ordered two types of pasta.
One of them was carbonara pasta with added shrimp, which I realized was an extra $50 when calculating the bill.
While the shrimp was large and tasty, I couldn't help but think it would have been better if the server had mentioned the price when taking the order, considering it's quite expensive.
The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is quite clean and stylishly presented.
However, the staff seemed a bit indifferent, and I didn't find the service from the servers particularly good.
It's a decent place to enjoy a casual meal or a date, but if you're looking for better service and taste, I wouldn't recommend it.
We hadn't visited since the pandemic, but we were happily surprised by how good the food and drinks were this time.
The pear martini was especially great.
We enjoyed the chopped salad, calabrese pizza, meatballs, Tagliatelle Bolognese, cacio e pepe pasta, and beignets for dessert - all of which were tasty.
Our server wasn't very attentive, though, and we often had to look around for him.
Lots of bakery options and the sweets are really a highlight.
we had a very nice brunch with delicious dishes and good options to share.
My point of attention is regarding diet restrictions, there are almost no options for restricted diets on the menu
Wonderful atmosphere though a bit loud because of high ceilings and no carpeting.
The food was excellent - good portions and made with care.
Club sandwich was good and the calamari was tasty.
Desserts were good too, and visually satisfying too!
Park next-door on the weekends for $7 instead of the $18 valet ($20 including tip).
Highly recommended.
Did not have a reservation but there was No waiting even though they were busy the whole time..
Loved the Salads, Louie was the best choice and pizza Burrata was outstanding.
Welcomed, valued atmosphere and great prices..
I haven't had these in almost five years, I had a friend go and I was off as it was MLK Day 1/15/2024 and it was amazing.
The taquitos were fresh and the line wasn't too bad.
We had to wait about 10mins.
The menu and hours are up to date.
First timer.
Amazing food.
Good prices.
Worth any waiting in the line.
Truly a gem of a mom & pop type eatery.
Limited seating, but I'd stand and eat this food no problem.
Don't pass this up.
It was our first time at Cielito Lindo on Olvera Street, which was fantastic!
We tried the two taquitos special with avocado sauce, which was delicious.
The warm champurrado drink was a treat.
We must have come on a non-busy day to find a short, quick-moving line.
A must-try!
ü•ëüç´
It is a classic place of an evening visit .
If you are downtown, have a walk around it opens late until 7 pm.
Great atmosphere and fair price.
Mexican experience.
Came here on a non busy day.
Was fortunate.
Limited spaces so I ate at the side of the walkway.
Plays part of the Mexican experience surrounded by Mexican stores and restaurants.
We found this place by accident after getting off the metro rail and walked in to get some snacks.
Shaggy the cashier was awesome when managing all the customers since it was packed.
He assisted everyone who needed help with something and checked everyone one out with little wait time.
I ordered red beans and rice with cornbread beignet hush puppies.
We also had a root beer from back east.
It was a bit pricey but we enjoyed everything and had a great experience.
Got takeout prior to watching an opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and ordered online for pickup.
We got a muffuletta as well as the seafood platter to split among four of us.
The muffuletta was very heavy on the bread and not so much on the meat.
I enjoyed the seafood platter more, which came with fried oysters, catfish, shrimp, and fries.
They gave us remoulade, tartar sauce, and ketchup on the side.
Credit cards accepted.
Counter service if you dine in.
Street parking.
Employees were friendly.
First time ever having food from here.
It's unique with a store and restaurant making it easy to find what you want while having great food.
There's parking on the side.
I will return whenever I travel Bank to LA
Had a wonderful experience here!
Enjoyed the shop aspect (on the side), with authentic Louisiana hush puppy batter, craft beer, cafe du monde coffee, hot sauces etc.
The food was bomb, just how you‚Äôd expect at a Po‚Äô boy place in NOLA.
I got the oyster fish (fried oysters, catfish) and my date got the fried shrimp po‚Äô boy.
Both were excellent; fresh bread, solid dressings, and hefty portions.
Tasted great with hot sauce!
All in all a great spot that I hope continues to thrive for years to come.
this was the most satisfying meal of all time.
please do yourself a favor and go here.
also i really loved the beignets.
got a mixed seafood platter and the catfish platter as well - generous portions done quick!
It is a small place in the middle of the market.
The food was delicious.
The waiter was nice and it was not so expensive.
El Rancho Grande is a hidden gem that brings the flavors of Mexico to Los Angeles in the most authentic and delightful way possible.
Located in [insert address], this restaurant has quickly become one of my favorite go-to spots for Mexican cuisine.
The moment you step inside El Rancho Grande, you're greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere.
The rustic decor, colorful artwork, and traditional music create an ambiance that immediately transports you to Mexico.
It's the perfect setting for a memorable dining experience.
The menu at El Rancho Grande is a true celebration of Mexican culinary traditions.
From classic dishes like enchiladas and tacos to more unique specialties, they offer a wide variety of options that cater to every palate.
The flavors are rich, vibrant, and incredibly satisfying.
Every bite is a taste of Mexico's finest ingredients and culinary techniques.
One of the standout dishes at El Rancho Grande is their mouthwatering carne asada.
The meat is tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, making it an absolute treat for the taste buds.
Paired with their homemade salsas and freshly made tortillas, it's a true delight that keeps me coming back for more.
This place has a soft spot in my heart, been coming since I was a child and my parents came to eat here since the 70's.
Nacho (the tall gentleman) is always friendly, takes a quick order, and preps your food.
You're here for an affordable, genuine home style meal, taquitos in particular.
Prices have closely crept up over the years but you can get a meal for around $12 (including small drink).
I usually order a #4 - 2 taquitos 1 cheese enchilada, beans with cheese and iceberg salad with tomatoes, and add an extra order of taquitos just to make my trip with it.
It's a small dine-in with quick turnover on the tables.
All meals are made as soon as you order so everything is fresh.
My only complaint is that the sauces are not spicy, very mild, BUT they have good flavor.
Tacos, bean and cheese burritos, enchiladas, sopes, quesadillas, and tostadas.
Make sure to wash it all down with an horchata or Jamaica.
Be warned, parking is a pain in the general area.
There's a small parking lot directly behind Rancho Grande but they charge by time if you just want to make a quick stop (and I mean quick) to avoid the $15+ flat fee parking lots around.
This place is fantastic!
Food was ready super fast and absolutely delicious.
Best sopes ever!
Jesse is so kind and helpful and he told us his family story of the restaurant.
What an incredible legacy.
LA history and incredible Mexican food.
Yum!
Food was Alright customer service was excellent but the food is not for me but other people may like it.
It‚Äôs something different
Remarkable food, remarkable service.
Today l had breakfast here for the first time and I must say this first impression made a lasting impression on me.
I was with my daughter, my mom and my sister.
We all enjoyed our meal to the last bite.
Oh and the complementary bread pudding.
Wow!!!
That delectable morsel of temptation served its purpose.
It left us longing for more.
Thank you all for a memorable experience.
The best high end dining experience I've had in Los Angeles, not only because of it's location right across from the visually stunning Walt Disney Concert Hall, but also because of the delicious harmony of tastes, colors and textures in each and every dish.
The service is amazing, with the staff attentive to every request and inquiry, making you feel right at home.
They were so accommodating as well, noticing that I was cold and gave me a warm blanket and a heater at our table.
The food is outstanding.
We went with two appetizers, one side dish, and three entrees for three people, and two desserts.
That was more than enough food for all of us.
They surprised us with a Spanish flan for our special celebration, too.
I would 10/10 recommend this restaurant for any special occasion, including anniversaries, graduations, birthdays, and more.
Fantastic location situated within the Conrad Hotel in downtown LA.
The food is cooked to perfection with the utmost attention to detail and thoughtful presentation.
Staying at the hotel, ate breakfast and it was delicious.
The Greek yogurt parfait was the best I've likely ever had.
Be sure to sit at the bar at night and take in the ambiance.
Definitely would suggest coming here and it's worth it.
This is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life.
Everything from the food, drinks, atmosphere, and service was on point!
The lubina was cooked perfectly, and the mojo sauce that's paired with it is a great combination.
The beets were unexpectedly yummy, and it was a great addition with the tomato tartare.
For the "fennel soup" with crab, I was pleasantly surprised to see a good amount of crab and the flavors were excellent!
A must try if you love crab.
The "beefsteak tomato tartare" is now my favorite tomato dish!
This is another highly recommended dish if you're a tomato lover.
The music and ambiance is very modern and I loved the chill trance/house vibes.
Accompanied with tropical plants and lots of tequila you could mistake that you just went across the border.
We have an affinity for Chef Jose Andres!
Just a quick back story: one year, husband and I took a trip to Washington D.C. and visited 4 of Jose Andres' 5 restaurant, in that same trip!
Yes, we love him so much and delighted to have finally dined at San Laurel.
It is exquisite.
Absolutely one of the finest dining in DTLA.
We started with a couple signature cocktails: Husband had the Saints G&T - St. George fin, St. Germain, Chareau aloe vera liqueur (never heard of this, wow!
), ginger, Fever Tree Indian tonic water.
I had the Watermelon Report - Tito's vodka, watermelon, mandarin, lime, cilantro, chipotle, and cumin tincture - what an amazing mixture of fresh ingredients.
refreshing and immediately I was in a super good mood after the first sip.
Starters: Hiramasa Crudo - buttermilk leche de tigre, basil cucumber caviar, pickled blueberries, fresno chili, herb oil, lime.
that caviar involved some serious science!
What a recipe!
Lobster Salpicon - cucumber, tomato, green peppers, salsa rosa, lobster oil - nothing is wasted in Jose's cooking.
Main course: Wild mushrooms in Laurel Cream - fried farm egg (beautiful orange yolk), thyme, toasted pan de cristal (all the way from Spain!)
Wagyu Flat Iron - flat iron wagyu from Blackhawk Farms, kale, Maitake mushrooms escabeche, truffle jus.
ordered medium rare, our preference.
Was so tender and the kale and mushrooms makes the ultimate pairing, as mushroom is a good source of antioxidants, fiber, and much more :)  Every dish was amazing, with its own special flavor and textures.
Each dish was created with a lot of thought and creativity.
What a work of art!
We practically licked our plates clean by scarpetta (yes we do this often!)
Wine pairing: 2018 Vina Alberdi Reserva Rioja Alta, Tempranillo blend 2021 Embruix Vall Llach Priorat, Garnacha blend  We were celebrating our anniversary that evening and they really know how to make it special for you!
Alexandro, our server was super attentive, friendly, and just a perfect as the food was.
For dessert we chose the Pistachio cake and it was just lovely and light.
Served with strawberries, lime, and mascarpone sorbet.
And Cafe bombon - espresso with condensed milk, for those with a serious sweet tooth!
Oh my, they also presented us with a Happy Anniversary Flan, candle and all.
I wanted to cry it was so sweet of them.
We thoroughly enjoyed it all.
The view from the outdoor patio is spectacular.
It overlooks the wonderful Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Kodak moment.
So we will be back next month!
Perfect pre-show dinner date :)  Salud!
My wife and I celebrated our Valentine's date at this restaurant, and it was an unforgettable dining experience.
From the moment we stepped inside, the cozy and welcoming ambiance enveloped us, setting the stage for a truly romantic evening.
The menu was nothing short of impressive, offering a delightful variety of dishes that seemed to cater to our every craving.
Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece, showcasing a brilliant combination of ingredients that danced together perfectly on the palate.
The flavors were rich, sophisticated, and beautifully balanced, reflecting the high level of culinary expertise behind their creation.
Not to be overlooked, the drinks selection was extensive, featuring everything from classic cocktails to non alcoholic beverages, ensuring the perfect pairing for every course of our meal.
The attentive staff recommended excellent choices that complemented our meals exquisitely.
In every aspect, this place delivered a luxurious dining experience that made our Valentine's celebration truly special.
The care and detail put into every aspect of our visit were evident, making it a place we would highly recommend to anyone looking to create memorable moments over exceptional food and drink.
Absolutely amazing experience, the staff was very friendly!
I can understand it‚Äôs a high end restaurant but ‚Äúlet us breathe‚Äù don‚Äôt come to the table every couple of minutes to check on the food or pour the water which is a very kind gesture but no need at all!
This one staff member was absolutely amazing and super friendly which i loved and wished i got his name!
The restaurant is at the ground floor of the hotel‚Äôs lobby.
Nice interior and ambience.
Staffs are friendly and service was fantastic.
Ordered the pre-theatre menu via Timeout.
We paid ¬£30pp for 3 courses including a glass of house wine.
Had the octopus for starters, pan seared cod for mains and pear tart for dessert.
Pear tart was quite good, the rest were ok.  Great place to catch up with friends in a less noisy setting.
We also didn‚Äôt feel rushed to leave the restaurant.
I ordered the theatre menu.
The food was good and everything was well made, the produce was fresh and high quality.
But it lacked layers in texture and flavor.
So even though everything was well prepared it still tasted a bit flat.
But all in all I had a good dining experience and the staff was very friendly, especially Juliana and Yvette.
A lovely time with the family for my partner's birthday lunch.
Bottomless brunch.
Lobster Benedict was amazing.
Our lovely waiter Anastasiia was attentive at every step, Vivien the Manager visited our table to welcome us.
Marek, the Bartender made an excellent birthday cocktail for my partner.
Tobacco dock was delicious!
Thank you and will visit again.
Visited in September 2023.
4.5/5.
First time visit to GBR, for an evening meal on a Friday evening, for an after work catch up with family in late September.
The restaurant was high on my list to visit and I was very pleasantly impressed.
The food was incredible.
The freshest produce used to make a delicious meal.
We had Pork Tenderloin and Spring Lamb for mains, with this delightful Mushroom Souffl√©.
All cooked to perfection.
The all day menu has plenty of choices for all tastebuds.
The restaurant was beautifully decorated, with fresh white linen.
The service was great and almost personal.
The atmosphere was a bit drab considering it was a Friday night in Mayfair, it wasn‚Äôt that busy (which is probably blessing in disguise).
A worthwhile experience, for all occasions.
Tonight my partner and I dined at GBR for the first time to celebrate our 8th anniversary.
It was quite honestly the best restaurant experience we have ever had as Londoners (and we eat out all the time in the ‚Äòbest‚Äô restaurants in town).
Lucas was so incredibly attentive, and his team were brilliant too!
The food was delicious and beautiful presented.
I have truly found my new favourite place to dine in London.
It‚Äôs a hidden gem!
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è THANK YOU ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Great place for quite dinner.
We went there on Thursday night and the place was quite busy but the same time quite enough to have a pleasant evening.
Service was good, they didn‚Äôt rush us for the order like some places dose.
When we were not ready to order (took us a while to decide, we just couldn‚Äôt stop chatting)they give us enough time.
What I like the most is the really nice and simple menu.
Only few starters which you can have either small portion as a starter or a bigger for the main course.
Lovely and fresh food.
Feels like a bit overprice but I guy you pay for all the  package.
We were traveling from the US and celebrated my father‚Äôs 65th birthday in early June.
It was stunning.
The foods are amazing, especially their signature tomahawk.
Service is fabulous.
Thank you for creating such a memorable experience for us.
It‚Äôs so pretty in here!
Loved the ambience, the staff was great, and the food was üî•üî•üî• Lovely little spot around the Buckingham Palace.
I had the seasonal meal of a souffl√© soup as a starter and the belly of pork as the main and it was ü§åüèº best pork I‚Äôve ever had.
My family had the burger and they thought it was great.
Restaurant is quaint and cozy.
Also, one of the few that are open for service quite late, like after seeing an evening show in the area.
The pizza was very very average.
If you are hungry, it does what it needs to.
But wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you are looking for a great pizza.
Love love love this place, nice little place in Soho, had dinner with friends on a Thursday night, even though we hadn‚Äôt booked and they were busy, they managed to get us a table which was great.
lovely atmosphere, great service, food was tasty, flavoursome and appetising.
Highly recommend and we will definately be going again.
The food was very good but they charged 25% of service ‚Ä¶.. and we were only 4.
I don‚Äôt know what it is for but that was very expensive.
We had a few drinks at the bar and it‚Äôs was absolutely fabulous.
Neil was a great bar man and very good host.
The vibe is brilliant.
Music great drinks range extensive.
Really worth a visit.
Had great experience at this authentic old style London Italian restaurant.
The waiters where outstanding (big shout to Neil AKA Nelly) .
The food portions where extremely generous and prices where incredibly lower than expected for central London restaurant.
The special thing for me was its association with Bar Italia next door which another place I‚Äôd recommend.
Our party of 7 arrived early for a business meeting dinner and were promptly seated by the First Gentleman, which we appreciated.
Our server took our order within 5-10 minutes, but after waiting for 30 minutes, we were still without our drinks.
It became evident that the table next to us, seated 15 minutes after our arrival, had already received their orders while we barely had tap water to drink.
After 45 minutes, only 80% of our drinks and one small plate had been brought to the table.
When I inquired about the rest of my order and missing drinks, the server responded rudely.
With no food in sight for anyone at our table, we sought assistance from another server who promptly addressed our concerns.
Unfortunately, when the food finally arrived after 1 hour and 15 minutes, it was lukewarm or cold, leaving us hungry and frustrated.
Adding to the dissatisfaction, staff members were seen carrying bags of rubbish through the dining area, passing numerous tables, which we found unsanitary.
We expressed our disappointment to the manager, who offered to remove the service charge and drinks from our bill, but this felt unfair to those who didn't receive their drinks.
Additionally, a free dessert was offered, but given the overall terrible experience, we declined.
This was, without a doubt, the worst dining experience at a Bill's restaurant, and none of our party will be returning.
Went in for Sunday lunch.
Was super busy.
Many people had booked.
The brunch menu goes until 5.
The food was good.
Halloumi fries were delicious.
The avocado on sour dough with eggs and streaky bacon was also good.
Just needed more seasoning.
Today we enjoyed a delightful brunch experience at Bill‚Äôs Soho restaurant.
The atmosphere was vibrant and cozy, with friendly staff providing excellent service.
The diverse brunch menu offered mouthwatering dishes, and my meal was both delicious and beautifully presented.
Highly recommend!
Food was tasty, we both had shawarmas.
It is somewhat light meal, so if you are very very hungry, I would go with burger.
Service was great, ambient too.
We had great time.
This place was outstanding!
We walked in during a non busy time and were seated right away.
The service was good, the atmosphere was fun, and the food was delicious!
We were not very hungry so we just ordered appetizers but we wish now that we had enough room for some of the other dishes and desserts!
Definitely a place to visit while in Picadilly Circus!
Thank you, Bill's!
Ikoyi had excellent food and a great ambience but at a decidedly steep price point.
The tasting menu had some excellent dishes, especially when it came to the sauces and wringing flavour from vegetables in creative ways.
Both the rib and the octopus were incredible.
Unfortunately, especially the West African elements that Ikoyi likes to advertise, like the Jollof rice, underdeliver relative to everything else and relative to the fine dining expectations.
I was pleasantly surprised by some of the innovative dessert dishes which often fall flat in fine dining.
All that being said, I would not call the experience twice as good as the average 150¬£ 1-star restaurant.
To make matters worse, when we went we ended up being overcharged by about 210¬£ due to waitstaff errors.
The mistake ended up being resolved but left a bitter after-taste given that we were paying a premium for excellent and attentive service.
Prepared dishes were pleasant, but not wow'ed.
It's a missed opportunity that the service team didn't spend time to engage and explain the matching of ingredients and design that goes into the dish.
The tea pairing was enjoyable.
My usual habit when dining at a Michelin restaurant is to place order for sparking water with a few ask with it.
It will show how much the staff is paying attention, and if they considered the customer experience; as these will give a preview of what I am going to get for my entire evening.
On this regards, the house has failed to impress.
Excellent food with a twist at this luxury restaurant.
Set behind a non-descript door on the corner of The Strand and Surrey Street.
It is easy to walk past, we did twice.
There is only the brown door with the name on it in mid-size script.
Once inside it is a very Scandinavian with clean lines and muted lighting.
The first thing to notice is the food store with turbot and meat hung to age to perfection.
That sets the tone for the evening, discrete but with attention to detail and to providing good quality.
There Is no menu to choose from, a seven course blind tasting menu is the standard offering, or rather the exceptional only offering.
All tables start service between 18:00 and 19:00 to allow for dedicated service to the table and exacting preparation in the kitchen.
The tastes seemed to me to be mainly Nigerian influenced with quite a lot of spices I didn't recognise.
I found all the dishes interesting in a very good way.
There was one dish where the parts seemed to me not to fit together, even though they were individually very good.
Definitely a worthwhile dining experience and one I would be happy to go through again.
I just need to save some money for it.
I had the most incredible dining experience at Ikoyi Restaurant, making it the best meal I've had this year.
From start to finish, everything about this restaurant was exceptional.
The ambiance was enchanting, with a perfect blend of contemporary elegance and a touch of African flair.
It set the stage for an unforgettable evening.
The menu was a culinary masterpiece, offering a unique fusion of West African and European flavors.
Every dish was a work of art, both visually and in terms of taste.
The flavors were bold, innovative, and utterly delicious.
The use of rare ingredients and spices showcased the chef's remarkable talent and creativity.
The service was impeccable, with a knowledgeable and attentive staff that enhanced the overall experience.
They were more than happy to explain each dish and even made personalized recommendations based on our preferences.
Overall, Ikoyi Restaurant provided a culinary journey like no other.
It's an experience that I'll cherish, and I can confidently say it's the best meal I've enjoyed this year.
If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience that pushes the boundaries of flavor, Ikoyi is a must-visit.
I did not think it was possible to love a meal this much.
Gorgeous setting, incredible staff, inventive food pairings with every mouthful somehow better than the last.
A special thank you to our Sommelier who suggested beautiful wines, including my first taste of orange wine!
I cannot wait to return to such a special place.
Pasta: TOO DRY.
Mussels were not fresh at all.
worst pasta in my life.
Steak: TOO DRY.
Overcooked.
Service: I waited almost 50 mins to have food since ordered.
When i complained, manager did not even say sorry.
I would have microwave food rather than eating in here.
Í∞ÄÏßÄÎßàÏÑ∏Ïöî Ïù∏Ïä§ÌÑ¥Ìä∏Î≥¥Îã§ Î™ªÌï¥Ïöî
Great value for money!
we enjoyed pizza, mix starters, wine, ice cream and coffe.
They spoiled us
I think this place was okay.
The service was fantastic, they were really nice and everything came out on time.
The atmosphere is also great, and I enjoyed our time there.
The food, unfortunately, lacked salt and seasoning.
I'm not sure what happened but we had to add a lot of salt, pepper and parmesan for the meal to taste well, but it was still not enough, the food just lacked flavour.
The portions were great for the price though.
From the outset, we encountered a series of issues that demonstrated a lack of respect for us as customers and for the very concept of hospitality.
Below is a breakdown of the issues we faced:  1.
**Reservation Not Honored:** Despite having a reservation, it quickly became apparent that it was not taken seriously.
No table was ready for us upon arrival, and the staff seemed confused and unprepared  2.
**Unnecessary Inconvenience:** Our experience was further marred by being asked to move up and down the stairs as the staff scrambled to find us a table.
This lack of organization not only wasted our time but also conveyed a clear disregard for guest comfort.
3.
**Lack of Basic Service:** Once we were finally seated, the service did not improve.
We were left without menus, forcing us to wait aimlessly and wonder about the meal options.
4.
**Inadequate Seating Arrangement:** Adding insult to injury, the proposed seating arrangement was to split our group of six into two separate tables‚Äîfour at one and two at another.
This suggestion was not only inconvenient but also detracted significantly from our dining experience, as we had intended to enjoy our meal together as a single group.
Given these compounded issues, we felt our only option was to leave as we had 2 children with us as well.
I hope this feedback prompts this place to improve its service and treatment of guests.
I ate there for 3 times and I noticed that their food is really appetizing which is commendable and I found their staffs are very sincere with customers.
Loved it..‚ù§Ô∏è
Excellent place to eat, we had a fantastic time at this restaurant, it's my third visit, it's still great.
Good atmosphere, diverse menu, everything delicious.
Super kind service.
I will definitely be back
Beautiful architectural hotel but the inside wasn‚Äôt as nice.
We were seated in the lounge area for our afternoon tea.
It was fine, just not anything spectacular.
I chose English Breakfast tea and it wasn‚Äôt hot which is the way I like it.
The quality of the tea was mediocre.
The sandwiches, cakes and scones were also not the best in taste.
This was just an average experience.
However the presentation of everything was beautiful.
Customer service was above average so thank goodness for that!
Olena was our waitress and she was absolutely amazing.
Looked after us really well !
Thank you Olena.
We will be back becuase the service was amazing
Food and experience was extremely disappointing!
I was told that the afternoon tea here was award winning and a must try but I was extremely disappointed.
I stayed at the hotel for a week and the breakfast buffet takes place at the same room as the afternoon tea.
I would say 50% of the items appeared to come from the same ingredients from the free breakfast buffet.
Sandwiches, scones, and pastries were all mediocre.
I do not recommend getting their recommended tea, it tasted like cough medicine unless that's your flavor of choice.
Although they accommodated, they are not very friendly when it comes to dietary restrictions/allergies but maybe this is just from the one wait staff.
When I told her I am highly allergic to nuts, she scoffed as she wrote it down on her notepad as if it was such a burden for her.
It made me feel bad because it wasn't like I asked to be deathly allergic to nuts.
I would love to chow down on some honey roasted cashews like more fortunate people.
Funny thing was it was already noted in our reservation but it seemed like neither the staff nor kitchen was prepared for it, so I don't understand what the point was to include it in the reservation notes.
Once we were attended to by a staff, we were sat down at a table that was only half set up.
I'm not sure why they sat us there because all the other tables were fully set up.
I am hoping to god it's not a racism move towards Asians.
Pricey and lovely afternoon tea experience in the lounge marred by occasional strollers and luggage carts rumbling through to use the ramp to the lobby.
We had two tables of 3 and 4 across from each other last week.
At my table for three, we enjoyed a vegan tea.
The scones and biscuits were slightly dry that were fixed by berry jam and plant-based butter.
The tea sandwiches were very good.
Our server was excellent and did everything to make us comfortable and happy.
There was so much food that it actually served as a late lunch.
We shared refrigerated leftovers with hot tea in our room there the next afternoon.
It was a welcome break from sightseeing, especially during cold, windy weather.
I recommend reservations, as they had limited tables for walk ins.
This restaurant is undeniably stunning to look at but the menu is not quite to my taste.
Still, it will make for a very impressive date location, so I recommend visiting at least once.
There was no background music playing when I visited so go with good company üòÖ I had a main of lamb.
Dessert with kumquat and orange wine.
Wine lovers will be glad to know that the wine list is quite long here.
On a magical spring evening, my friends and I found ourselves stepping into the enchanting realm of Spring, a restaurant renowned for its culinary masterpieces and classy ambiance.
We were gathered there to celebrate a special birthday.
The restaurant was a vision of elegance, adorned with blooming flowers and soft lighting that cast a warm, inviting glow over the entire space.
The menu was a work of art, offering a tantalizing array of dishes that promised a gastronomic adventure.
Each course that arrived was amazing.
It was nice to celebrate spring in the Spring!
Thanks to all team.
Based in one of the wings of Sommmerset house, Spring could so easily have been a run of the mill F&B outlet catering to the West End crowd.
Instead, it the restored 19th century Drawing Room,  Skye Gynell (formally of Petersham Nurseries fame) and her team have created something really special.
Working closely with biodynamic farm Fern Verrow to bring the UK's best produce to London, this is expensive, elegant and dripping with a style.
We had the 'Scratch Menu', a zero waste menu, changing daily and with limited available - Tuesday to Saturday between 5.30pm and 6.30pm and is limited to 30 guests per evening.
At ¬£30 per head, this is an excellent value for the space, and their ongoing work with Food Waste charity Felix Project shows their commitment to this area.
Really relaxing environment and great food.
The service is efficient and professional.
Would come here again.
The waiter mentioned they change the dinner menu every 2 weeks
Beautiful dining room with a minimalist vibe.
Had the scratch menu and the starter was exceptional.
My paloma cocktail was also delicious.
Unfortunately,  the rest of the meal was good, but not great.
The dessert, in particular, was disappointing.
Overall, a good experience, though, and worthy of trying again.
As is often the case never trust a review in the national press.
One that was effervescent with praise drew us here.
The best bit was the service.
I note that some reviews have complained about this but we found it attentive.
That said we were eating after the pre-theatre dinner crowd and the place was all but empty.
So good service but a dull atmosphere.
Sadly the food did not match the price.
It wasn't that it was poor but there was no wow factor.
Both seafood dishes were unremarkable.
The terrine good but presented as a slab on a plate; the ox-cheeks were better.
Slow cooked and deep with flavour.
The rhubarb crumble good but the tart too cloying and no more than might be found in a canteen.
So unfortunately a place to visit once but not return.
Cute and quiet spot for an elevated British meal - the cod, the crumbed chicken and the anchovies were excellent and the apple pie was a perfect finisher.
Service was a bit slow but good/sweet.
Great spot, especially for a pre/post theatre meal
a pre theatre perfect meal!
service was very attentive and always there when needed, the food itself was delicious but ranking just below the asking price‚Ä¶ the choices for the set course could of been more expanded but for the price it makes sense.
definitely a recommend place especially if you‚Äôre going to see a show after!
saves the hassle!
Lovely pre-theatre meal here.
Excellent and very warm service.
Very stylish and elegant interior.
We were there for a family meal but would be a great date venue.
We came to Lasdun before a play at the theatre.
Being a group of 20, service can sometimes be slow, but not here.
They were on top of everything!!
And the food, oh my.
Simply exquisite!
Everything was delicious from start to finish.
Would definitely eat here again and again if we were local.
The restaurant had a really nice atmosphere, the view was good too.
I have the say the food was not very impressive.
It started well with the bread and the burrata starter, which were actually quite amazing.
But I can't say the same for the main and desert.
I ordered the lamp chops, which were overcooked and dry.
I won't comment on the guineafowl as I don't really like the taste of the meat.
The side of vegetables was bland and under seasoned, the mash was very nice and creamy.
For desert we ordered the marmalade pudding and the chocolate mousse.
Both of them were very underwhelming.
Don't think I would go back to be honest.
Gave 4 stars as the service was really good and staff very attentive.
Perfect place for dinner.
Could pair a visit to the national portrait gallery either dinner after.
Located walking distance from Leicester sauce, charring cross and embankment tube stop , located on the 4th floor with good views of the dome of national gallery and better views in day light.
Nice modern minimalist interior with open kitchen.
Good seating for two adjacent to the windows and a nice view and for four, two get a good view whilst two backs are against the view.
Negronis was average, the salt and vinegar martini was excellent.
Good- surprisingly good, modern, innovative, small portions.
Found the duck heart on bread with foie gras paste very good  as was the burrata( small portion) with orange segments.
The mushroom carpaccio was more average, vinaigrette too overpowering.
Mains: guinea fowl was average, skin with fat under was too fatty for me and the meat under on the dry side.
Good accompaniment sauce.
The lamb was good- quite a fatty portion.
Well cooked.
The smoked haddock was good.
Deserts : the Syrian saffron rice was average.beautifully presets dish but did not wow from a taste perspective.
The marmalade steam pudding was terrible sweet served with cream anglaise.
The pot cream, blackberries, shortbread was the best of the three, almost like a creme brulle with blackberries on the top.
Service attentive.
The bill: there was reviews noting that the VaT was not added to the price but done so at the end and this is incorrect.
The prices on the menu reflect that of the final price with vat, just at bill level, there is a vat noted on there with the additional of 13.5%[ above the standard London 12.5%].
The Portrait restaurant offers a decent view of London!
Positioned on the top floor of the National Portrait Gallery, it serves European cuisine.
However, the food is pretty standard, nothing very stand out.
Do visit mainly for the view and perhaps enjoy a couple of drinks.
Daytime provides a better and more delightful view.
My husband and I stumbled on this restaurant late in the evening after a long day.
We were tired and hungry.
I thought this might be a simple place to pick up a sandwich.
It was much fancier than I expected, but my meal ended up being my favorite in London.
I got the gazpacho to start.
It was amazing.
We also had a table by the window with a great view.
On the top floor of the National Portrait Gallery.
Just ask at the gallery reception how to get there rather than wandering around the gallery and having to be rescued by one of the restaurant staff, like we did.
Good food and service with amazing views over Trafalgar Square and down to the London Eye.
Very friendly staff and THE best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had.
Food was ready pretty quickly!
Would recommend 100% going here.
Also a pretty good variety of vegetarian and vegan food.
Try the bruschetta when visiting!
3/5, primarily due to the atmosphere.
The place was quite busy on Friday around 21:00.
The waiters were really nice and prompt, and the food came quickly.
However, when we arrived, the place was fully lit with all sorts of lights, so it was quite bright inside.
As for the music, if you enjoy "Music Sounds Better With You" by Stardust, you're going to love this place.
It felt more like a canteen than a small family restaurant.
If you're looking for good, fast food in central London, Pasta Brown is the place to go.
I would not recommend it for a date night or a nice romantic dinner.
Whilst walking through the vibrant streets of London and somewhat peckish we came across this Italian eatery.
After a short 15 minute wait on a busy Saturday evening we were seated.
Food swiftly followed, a large portion of pasta and some garlic bread.
Highly recommended
Clearly very popular as the place was jam packed.
I was amazed at how quickly our food arrived considering how busy they were!
Food was lovely, good straightforward menu so would be a nice place to take the kids.
We had pasta, pizza, bruschetta and olives.
The portion of olives was huge.
Bruschetta was good, but lots of parsley which was a bit off putting (only because I'm not keen on parsley).
The arrabiata was really nice.
Staff were really smiley and friendly and kind.
We felt really welcome!
My most recent visit to Pasta Brown was a lunch visit.
In the past we‚Äôve been there for dinner.
It has the benefit of being a family run restaurant, not a chain.
They have an allergies menus, which was very good.
We were greeted with snacks, so we had something to nibble on as we chose our food.
My wife had the penne alla costadina and I had spaghetti with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and spinach (spaghetti all‚Äôs Roma?).
Both were very tasty and well seasoned.
The staff were great.
It was my first trip to UK for holiday; and The Ritz Restaurant was one of the "must visit".
Booking online was a little challenging for single diner; but after sending an email to the reservation team, the problem was quickly resolved and my table was confirmed.
Thank you so much for the prompt response.
The dining experience is nothing short of expectation.
It's only when stepped into the place, you appreciate the ask for dress code.
It does uplift the vibe of the place.
As I arrived slightly early before the restaurant is ready to open its door; I was invited to have a seat at the lounge area and soon was invited to join for dinner.
The restaurant is as beautiful as seen in picture.
Service and food are great; served with great drama and fanfare for some of the dishes.
Overall experience, superb.
Even better than some of the 2 stars establishments I have tried in UK.
While on vacation in London and on my way to have an experience of a life, I stepped inside the Ritz Hotel, invited by the steward who saw that I was taking pictures of the outdoor Christmas decorations, which are truly understated, in comparison to the ones inside!
The Ritz-Carlton has a restaurant bar that accepts walk-ins but prefers reservations, especially for those who are not guests of the hotel.
After a busy morning, I returned for a second time to look at the decor and to have lunch.
I was incredibly happy to be accommodated, thank you very much!
At the restaurant bar, I had a famous mouthwatering Ritz Club paired with a delicious glass of wine from the vineyards of Tuscany.
In addition, i was served complimentary starters that included the best olives I ever had!
Antonio, the multilingual English, also Spanish speaking server, made my experience delightful as he catered to my needs.
I truly enjoyed the wine recommendation, but more importantly, my overall experience at the restaurant bar, and you will be happy to know the prices were also reasonable.
On my way out I stopped to take a picture of the Christmas tree, which has to be three stories high, but while attempting the photograph, I was asked to move away from a tiny hall, that leads  into stairs which lead to, I assume a guest only area.
I enjoy exploring hotels, restaurants... attractions that I may write helpful reviews for those looking to enrich their life with an amazing experience  While Antonio was phenomenal, not everyone is helpful or friendly at this hotel, and it is quite disappointing given it is considered a luxury five-star hotel!
I don't think so, not with the tone or disposition, of the gentleman, i sure wish i asked for his name  As far as i am concerned and in order to be a guest at a five star hotel, I would like to know i will be treated with a kind and friendly disposition, an arrogant and condescending attitude is totally unacceptable!!
For that reason I would not recommend the hotel but do recommend that a welcoming and friendly disposition should be required of all employees, not just the servers at the restaurant bar!
Afternoon Tea at The Ritz has definitely been on my bucket list for a while and today I got to tick that off.
The Ritz itself is, as I had imagined, beautiful.
A feast for the eyes.
The area where you eat Afternoon Tea is full of splendour and all the food was delicious and plentiful.
All sandwiches & cakes were so tasty, with lots of different choices.
Without us asking, we were offered extra sandwiches & scones at no extra charge.
You could also have a choice of more than one kind of tea, so absolutely worth the money, but it‚Äôs not cheap at ¬£84.
Staff were very friendly and attentive.
All in all I‚Äôm very happy I got to tick this off today ü§©ü§©
4 star rating relative to Michelin starred restaurants.
Obviously the food is splendid and the atmosphere is unique old school England.
Great for a special occasion.
We loved the langoustine appetizer,  spectacular in a delicious creamy sauce.
The duck was wonderful,  with an exquisite shimmering sauce, just like it should be.
My wife had the veal, which would have been better if more rare.
For dessert we shared the banana souffle, sans chocolate sauce-- against the advice from the waiter.
But it was delicious.
Great place for old school charm, without the old school cooking.
Came here for a business celebration with my partner and we couldn‚Äôt be happier.
Exquisite service and some of the tastiest food we have ever eaten.
The singing and piano entertainers were fantastic also, and the waiting staff were all very friendly and welcoming.
Will certainly be coming again soon for the Live at the Ritz night.
After reading all the good reviews we were looking forward to dine at Clermont hotel's restaurant.
The service was mediocre from the begining however the food started on a good note.
Both the Calamari and Falafel starters were delicious.
Unfortunatelly the rest of the food didn't meet our expectations.
The mains were absolutely tasteless, okay at best and with the lack of service that was all I could say when they asked how was it.
Dessert were also just okay, nothing special.
I wish we could have had that 5 star experience as everyone else.
Maybe we went on the wrong day at the wrong time, but not worth a second try..
Used a voucher I got online and definitely felt like I got value for money spent.
Afternoon tea for 2 deal came with 2 glasses of prosecco, which was lovely.
Excellent service by Cyan, very pleasant & attentive!
Loved her.
She made our experience there an enjoyable one.
FYI this is situated within the beautiful Clermont Hotel, we didn't realise this at first ;) My friend and I had an impromptu girly afternoon out in London and we found this Afternoon tea experience purely by chance, we hadn't booked but the staff were lovely and accommodated us in the pretty conservatory area so we were very lucky.
The Afternoon Tea with Prosscco was delightful and plentiful, with bite size treats so you managed to eat it all even the Scones (which at other venues we leave as no room!)
We throughly enjoyed it here and will definitely pop back in the Summer for another treat!
Thank you to everyone.
First time visiting the UK and went here with my significant other for afternoon tea.
The restaurant is located inside the Amba Hotel.
We were seated next to the huge windowed balcony which supplied a lot of beautiful natural lighting into the room and a lovely view.
The staff were super friendly.
The food came out beautifully presentable and the staff explained the menu items.
Amazing experience for our first afternoon tea.
This is the restaurant of the Clermont Charing Cross hotel, on the first floor.
So it's a great location, literally right next door to Charing Cross station.
We ate breakfast here each morning of our stay, and we ate dinner here one rainy evening.
The restaurant is beautiful.
The tables are close together, so you may not have the opportunity for a quiet conversation.
Our food was very good.
Service was slow--our server sometimes disappeared--but otherwise we had enjoyable meals here.
This is an vegan friendly Italian restaurant - for my partner.
The rest of my guests were meat eaters.
All of us were delighted with our pasta.
I shared the lobster pasta with my friend and we loved it.
The portion was plenty and the lobster was fresh and sweet.
I had just enough room in my belly to squeeze in a tiramisu at the end.
I have to give a special shout out to the attentive waiter who served us all night.
My friend and I dined at this restaurant last week Friday.
Customer Service 10/10, we arrived early, and we were seated straightaway.
We ordered the buratta for the starters and lobster pasta for our mains, and they both tasted so good.
The lobster pasta is a sharing main for 2, very good portion and very filling for hungry bellies.
I would definitely recommend and visit again.
The service was good and fast.
The starter was delicious, the pasta was too salty.. food in general ok, nothing special..
Fresh, tasty and affordable homemade pasta made fresh every day.
Try the seasonal dish.
If unsure, do ask.
For instance, right now, the mushroom pasta with fresh mushrooms and a hint of lemon is to die for.
Chris, the previous manager, has been promoted within the business, but the wonderful Alicia (pronounced Aleesia) is doing the most wonderful job.
If you want to go at peak times, you must absolutely book.
Otherwise, it is easy to get a table if you are flexible, in between regular mealtimes, since they are open all day.
Do also try the special drinks and desserts.
They are constantly changing the menu, which is one of the most vegan friendly menus I have ever seen.
Vegans have their own menu.
I do wish the music could be turned down a bit so that you can hear (and talk) more easily, but that is my only niggle.
I am a massive fan.
Good location, pasta was fresh and tasted great.
Had traditional and modern twists on the menu.
Drinks were reasonably priced.
Enjoyed it and felt was good food, well priced with a good location.
The moment you step in the restaurant you know you are in for a good experience.
Service with a smile , attention to detail , we had a good welcome and explained the dish of the day .
Mocktails on this occasion, presentation and flavour wow.
The food was absolutely delicious.
Fillet steak bursts of flavours , the peppercorn sauce just made it that much more delicious.Apple tart for dessert perfect finish to our meal.
The style and ambience was so delightful and a pleasure to experience in the hospitality industry.
It was truly a refreshing experience we also had lots of time to catch up with each other.
Thank you for a great evening.
I went 2 times  , once was dinner second was for the restaurant & bar  for chilling with friends both was nice i suggest the food was amazing , and drinks  are the best , bar is nice but i prefer watching the lights and the atmosphere i love the lights and the interior design as well ,  if you want a romantic night deffinitely the best option , if you want a good night out with friends best option either , your decision, cheers ü•Ç
Seated in the enclosed garden area, we could enjoy natural daylight with a bit of air con which made us very comfortable in the hot weather.
The items in the afternoon tea set were all very delicious and so were the teas.
I particularly like the teas as they were special blends/ flavoured which I haven‚Äôt come across in other restaurants.
Excellent service by the team too!
We did the afternoon tea experience.
Nobody in our party was very satisfied with it.
The server was not very attentive and they messed up two of our tea orders.
The food was pretty bland only a couple of the pastries had real flavor.
The price was on par for some other places.
I guess we know why this had a reservation open the night before.
I would book early somewhere else or not waste your money on this experience.
Just enjoyed a special weekend at the Ham Yard Hotel.
Every member of Hotel staff we encountered, from Concierge, reception, Waiting Staff, to Restaurant staff were Friendly, polite and very helpful.
That is our genuine observation.. it‚Äôs a lovely place to stay because of them..
A lovely little French restaurant near Covent Garden & Seven Dials.
It feels very traditional, in streets packed with chains and restaurants from famous chefs, and it has a good menu of French classics, with good wines.
We visited as a group of six and were very well looked after.
My beef cheeks were great, as was was the chocolate fondant.
Went there to celebrate my birthday, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the meal!
Super authentic French food, tastes delicious and cooked perfectly!
I was just sad that my steak tartare as my appetiser was so small, but maybe I should‚Äôve gotten it as a main :) I will definitely come back!
The onion soup was also really delicious!
I think price wise it‚Äôs a bit on the high side, but not the most expensive French restaurant I‚Äôve been to.
And you get your money worth.
Food was fantastic!
Service was friendly, but they could have been more attentive, especially since it was a very quiet lunch service when we went.
Total French experience, traditional and tasty!
We were seated in a different area for our second visit, not so atmospheric and a little brighter and noisier than our last visit.
Very good French restaurant.
Details very curated, good welcoming and really nice food (we loved the tartiflette).
An amazing restaurant that has stood the test of time, it‚Äôs over 100 years old!
Ordering the snails is a must.
Find classical French cooking at this place, in a comfortable setting, where it‚Äôs easy to catch up with friends and family.
There is bag and coat storage at reception.
Ladies toilets are on the upper floor, whereas the men‚Äôs toilets are on the ground floor‚Ä¶ For any of you on wheels.
Excellent service, with kind staff.
Shout out to the person who took my reservation via the phone, I really appreciate that they made a few jokes with me in a good natured way.
Beautiful place and the food was delicious.
We went there on Sunday and we chose to not have the Sunday roast but everything that we chose was absolutely delicious.
The bread was perfect and in my opinion a restaurant that make a good bread usually has a good food in general.
The price was perfect and the wine very delicious.
I will be back to try fillet of beef "Rossini".
Amazing decorations Amazing food Professional and helpful staff  Highly recommend it, specially for special occasions.
I had the wild mushroom risotto and my friends tried duck and steak!
We all loved what we had.
Oh, also the French onion soup which was the cherry on top
Fantastic lunch at the ‚ÄúOldest French Restaurant in London‚Äù.
Food and service was impeccable, highly recommended for lunch and/or dinner‚Ä¶.
and one of the very few Dog friendly restaurants in central London.
Snails with garlic butter sauce, definitely have lots of the delicious homemade bread to soak up all the remaining sauce.
Fillet Rossini cooked to perfection and a delectable light lemon tart to finish.
Then sit outside and watch the sights of Soho walking by.
Wonderful experience!
Very welcoming atmosphere with the deco, music and dim lights.
The lobster bisque, les escargots, the mushroom linguine and the wine selection were divine.
The pheasant not as much, unfortunately.
We‚Äôve also learned that there is a cosy live piano bar on the top floor - will certainly be back.
Very friendly staff.
We went straight to a table (about 1:30 pm).
Food served after 10 minutes or so.
Very good garlic bread and pizza.
The base was crispy with the right amount of topping.
Ordering the large pizza was a mistake, almost enough for two.
Total cost, including service charge ¬£44.44 for large pizza, king prawn pasta, garlic bread and water
This is one of 2 Prezzo restaurants that are close together.
We had good service and most of the staff were friendly.
There's lot's of choice on the menu with something for most people.
The portion sizes could have been better but not too bad for central London.
Food came very quickly and was well cooked.
Been here today for my mother in laws birthday and had a lovely time!
We had a voucher for her birthday so got a free bottle of prosecco too!
Food was delicious and the waiter was very friendly, all staff were!
Would definitely recommend if your looking for a nice place to eat üòä
Ordered my main meal tonight to celebrate a special day today.
¬£20 chicken dish .
Sounds great on paper.
It arrived, and  I was stunned it looked basic and dry when it arrived.
it didn't look appetising.
Grilled chicken was dry, with no taste.
Potato was boiled soft, no flavour sauce marinate.
Sweet heart cabbage grilled no grilled smokey taste.
I had to take my husbands fries sauce to add taste to my meal.
Ordered burger bun to make a  sandwhich trying to be creative with my meal.
Got the bill.
Charged ¬£6.50 garlic bread for the burger bread.
I was shocked.
I refused to pay that because that's the cost close to a kids' meal, which looked and tasted better than my main.
Staff who served us were polite he gets 5 stars.
And was able to discount the 6.50 to reflect a more reasonable cost for burger buns  Shame they couldn't accept my kids eat free voucher, which was valid until today, just not at all locations.
Should have stuck with plan A and gone to Bills.
They offered a 50% voucher including London location and probably wouldn't be served dry grilled chicken.
Had a great meal here.
Catered well for my granddaughter.
Managed to get us in (4 persons) at mid afternoon with just a two minute wait to prep table.
Food was good, arrived hot, drinks fairly average price for the area.
If you love BBQ, you will love it here.
The food was excellent, service was really good the band they had playing were fantastic.
We got lucky without booking but would highly recommend booking in advance.
Good selection of beers and cocktails and the food menu had so many options which all sound amazing.
Would definitely come again üòÉ
Excellent food, great staff, I was just passing by and went in on my own.
The smell from the BBQ pit hits you as you walk down the corridor, fiendly staff showed me to a table, excellent choice of meats, burgers, lobsters.
There's a live band playing downstairs, only thing is the mens toilets are a trek, there is a sign telling you that you're nearly there.
Great value on the specials!
We did the unlimited barbecue, and we couldn‚Äôt eat more than two plates worth.
The barbecue tasted great for the money.
We found the corn bread and shredded pork a little dry but still enjoyed it, but the ribs and chicken stood out to us.
Also authentic coleslaw!
Service was friendly and flexible, enjoyed our experience.
The portion is HUGE and the price is fair.
I love this restaurant.
It used to be busy, but I guess it‚Äôs because of the economy, there were not many ppl.
( I used to line up for 1 hour few years back ) I think the best dishes is the pork belly ribs ( not sure if it‚Äôs named this way ).
You need to ask the waiter to give you big easy sauce.
The sauce is the soul of the pork ribs.
But I‚Äôm bit disappointed in the Mac and cheese.
Like my fd said, it‚Äôs tasteless.. Other than the Mac and cheese, I think everything is fine here
This is a nice place to stop and grab something quick to eat.
I came here with my partner and we both got the lobster Mac and cheese- highly recommend if you like lobster and mac and cheese.
We both enjoyed it.
We also got bottomless fried shrimp to share because it was on offer so why not?
It was also nice, however we was quite full and so took it home for later.
It was nice food for the price also.
Great evening here.
Staff were welcoming and helpful.
Food was very tasty and beautifully presented.
There were plenty of choices on the menu including vegetarian and fish.
There were some different dishes from a standard Thai restaurant which was good.
I tried the soft shell crab and mango salad which was delicious.
I will definitely return for a third visit when I am next in London.
Atmosphere was amazing, dumplings were amazing, calamari was exquisite and the sauces provided were clearly hand made and not store bought.
Only let down was Lamb Shanks tasted bland for me personally , other than that, everything was amazing and I‚Äôd deffo go again.
Very nice of them to throw in a little birthday dessert on the house too.
I can not rave enough about this quaint little restaurant in the heart of Knightsbridge.
The BEST Thai food I have tasted in a while.
And I am a big Thai fan.
I am planning to bring all my friends here.
We are always looking for amazing places and as Thai food goes this is as authentic as it gets.
The staff and service are impeccable.
I was served by Wee and Cartoon and I can honestly say they were friendly, but above all did not keep their eyes off me incase I needed a top up or anything else.
Very warm friendly staff who clearly know what top tier service looks like.
They charged my phone for me, I didn‚Äôt want longer than expected for my food, the Merlot was perfect.
I will be raving about this restaurant until the end of time.
It‚Äôs definitely made the list.
And am thinking to bring the rest of the girls through as their Jan offer is outstanding!!
Check the pics for more info.
I also spied another tables Seanass and lamb shank.
My goodness.
On the next hit list for sure!
Honestly, Thai food is my weakness and the staff and food have won over my heart for good.
And their offer until the end of Jan and business set meal offer is amazing!!!
Without doubt my favourite Thai in London!!
I didn‚Äôt get a chance to take a pic of my food as my phone was very kindly on charge by the staff but the plates were straight out the warmer, the food was on a candle keeping warm while I ate, I packed what I could to go.
My housemate is trying this and we are bringing all our friends back for a round 2.
Love this place.
Such a find.
Thank you Patara ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very friendly personnel.
However I didn‚Äôt like the way my noodle was prepared.
It was watery and looks different from the picture on the menu card.
I complaint about this and they were very professional and friendly with their response which I really appreciate.
Went for a 3 course meal with my partner, the food was good but it more of a inspired dish rather than authentic dish.
Still very tasty but the flavours did not hit as well as I would expect thai food would be.
Amazing dessert, cannot fault that.
Lovely staff and medium noise level but seem a little quite to me as table next to me was listening to the conversation.
Overall great dinner experience and would give the place a go again.
We went for a team Christmas dinner and had a very fun evening.
The servers were friendly and attentive.
The starter (scallops) was delicious, the main (turkey) was decent and the dessert (Christmas pudding) was good.
I went to this restaurant to have lunch for my two-year-old son's birthday.
The food was great.
My son ate all the kid's chicken although he does not have an appetite.
The adult meal was very good for us as well.
And I was impressed by one waitress who served us.
She serves a birthday ice cream cake for my son even if we did not request it.
I should have given her tips but I lost to chance to do it.
Absolutely cannot fault this place.
Best meal I have had in a very very long time.
Went there this evening for a meal with my partner for my birthday.
The food was absolutely spot on.
Starter, main course and dessert were divine.
I'd ticked when booking it was my birthday and every single member of staff who served us remembered.
They kindly gave us a free glass of fizz and didn't charge us for our dessert.
It's the little things that make a big difference.
The venue is amazing.
The atmosphere at the main bar is lively and gorgeous but then you've got one of the dining areas tucked around the corner for a more intimate experience so you've the best of both worlds.
Will 100% recommend and 100% be back.
We had lunch here today and we really enjoyed it, the food was beautiful, we especially loved the Cider and Onion soup.
The interior is stunning, lovely waiter very attentive and chatty, we will definitely be back soon
Lovely restaurant and polite staff (something you don‚Äôt always find unfortunately), I have always been greeted here with a smile.
Something I feel is very important for a restaurant experience, not just the food.
The staff seem happy working here.
The food is also fantastic.
I never leave dissapointed.
I always order starter, main and dessert.
I think they have recently updated their menu as I had scallops here for the first time and it was fantastic!
Will be returning, we are regulars here and will continue to enjoy this lovely restaurant.
The Bastion Restaurant and bar is based inside of the Shankly Hotel so is easy to find and is a great place to eat.
We couldn't decide where to go for an evening meal so as we were staying at the Shankly decided to eat there, the prices were average for the restaurants in the area and it smelt great.
When we went downstairs we were seated immediately and given a drinks menu, and an early bird menu as well as the main one, so we both chose from the early bird.
The food came quickly, as did the drinks, and was cooked to perfection, we even managed to get to the sweet section which we don't normally and enjoyed every morsel.
So when we went to pay for 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 sweet a large wine and a pint of lemonade and orange juice it came to less than ¬£40 as you get 20% discount if staying in the hotel, wow what an absolute bargain.
As is the hotel the decor is football related and quirky but not in your face and was an absolute joy.
10/10.
Ps just loved the toilets üòç
Three of us ate here on a Sunday evening.
We had booked and when we arrived two tables were paying at the restaurant reception.
We had to wait several minutes before being shown to our table.
Other than that the service was good, as was the food.
We booked because our aparthotel gave us a voucher for 50% off food at the Bastion , so our ¬£120 bill (incl drinks) was reduced to ¬£80.
Excellent value.
First of all, I am in no way shape or form a football fan!
I came here with my 76 year old mother purely for somewhere to eat close to where we are staying.
That being said,  the atmosphere is lovely,  the memorabilia is actually subtle, tasteful and interesting even for me!
The food,  well that's another story!
Nothing subtle about fantastic food at amazingly good prices.
¬£25 pp for the set menu was more than worth the money.
The only mild downside for me personally was the TV screen showing sky sports in the restaurant.
I totally get that this is a football themed establishment  and the sound was turned down,  just a distraction in my own humble opinion,  I'm sure most patrons would be perfectly happy.
All in all a huge thumbs up from me and mum!
Fabulous meal and tasty drinks.
Starters and mains were all delicious and felt like good value.
Including 2 drinks for each of us came to 50.
My wife and I have just enjoyed an excellent afternoon tea at the Shankly hotel, along with copious amounts of tea and coffee, there was a glass of Prosecco each, a selection of sandwiches, rolls, and wraps, plus an array of mini cakes, topped off with scones, accompanied by jam and cream, well worth the money outlay.
All this in a restaurant housed in a beautiful listed building situated in the heart of Liverpool's business quarter, the walls decorated with scores of memorabilia dedicated to the great man's life and career.
I would definitely recommend a visit, we were even asked if we required a doggy bag to take home the left-overs, but it wasn't necessary as there was nothing left to take!
Oh, and the service was excellent too, quick, without being intrusive.
I advise you to treat yourself to a visit in the near future, you won't regret it
The high levels of customer service was one of the best aspects of this place.
Although the waitress did not write anything down, the orders were absolutely right.
Furthermore, she was able to make proper recommendations.
Although it was a Tuesday, the place was very crowded.
Watching what was transpiring outside was intriguing as The Cavern Pub is located opposite the resturant.
The chicken breast was just lovely.
I recommend this place because of the food, the location and the lively atmosphere.
Great food, but service could be better.
I asked for juice without ice, they brought me juice with ice, half a glass of ice.
We ordered mushrooms in cream - they didn‚Äôt bring it.
They reminded them again, but there was no point.
So we never saw them.
What a great place to have a late lunch on a very busy Saturday afternoon.
The food was tasty, well cooked and well presented by very friendly staff.
The noise outside was incredible, but what a good atmosphere inside and out.
The restaurant was clean and there was no rush to get the table back, would definitely recommend a visit , just try and get a window seat to watch the action outside it‚Äôs worth it.
The best fish and chips I have ever eaten.
The battery is crispy and special I think deep fried oil must be  changed  very regularly to keep the fish and chips golden colour..Very fast service and pleasant service.
I would like to thank to the üë®‚Äçüç≥.
Needed more atmosphere the staff were pleasant but felt slightly rushed thru starter and main.
Scouse was divine!
Maybe slightly overpriced cocktails also.
Could not recommend this place enough!
We arrived at about 18:00 looking for a meal and were seated after a short wait.
Menu is full of options ‚Äî I‚Äôd have gone with a margherita but there was this Gorgonzola pizza that tempted me, and I‚Äôm glad I chose it!
Delicious.
Food came quickly, service was great, overall a very good night
Amalia is a lovely Italian restaurant with nice staff and good food.
Would highly recommend booking in advance as it does get busy.
We got a table indoors on the ground floor.
For summer, they have loads of outdoor sitting to enjoy the loveky weather.
The staff were very nice and helpful, our meals arrived on time and were cooked to perfection.
If you are up for a big challenge, I would recommend you take the Calzone challenge (it's massive and could feed 3 people) - if you get to finish it alone within 1hr, you get it for free..... Have fun trying :-) All in all, I would highly recommend a visit to Amalia if you are in Liverpool City Centre for a great Italian meal.
They have won awards for their pizza over the last few years ( Hope to try it sometime soon)
Lovely food that just  smelt , looked and tasted amazing.
Will definitely have to go back .
They also had the coolest looking pizza cutter I've ever seen in a restaurant üòÇ
Amazing food and amazing service The only use their food bit more salty But all of their food coming with amazing quality There is it was too salty.
I told them they replace it.
Fabulous good quality food!
Some of the best Italian food I‚Äôve had.
Staff are really friendly and the restaurant is a relaxing environment.
I definitely recommend to visit!
I never leave bad reviews but this place really needs one.
I booked an afternoon tea for four of us.
My friends were from Greece and I wanted them to experience a proper English afternoon tea.
I picked the wrong place.
We were sat in the bar area even though we had a child with us, the atmosphere wasn‚Äôt great in there, there was a huge tv on and it felt like we were sat in a pub not a restaurant.
It took almost an hour for our tea to arrive, no explanation was given about what was on the trays (which were wonky and unstable) so we had to just guess what was what.
We never saw a menu.
The only choice of drinks we were given were standard tea or coffee, very basic.
The sandwhiches were dry and the bread tasted stale, the scones had clearly been frozen and were so dry the just crumbled when you cut them.
Not worth the ¬£25 each.
I was so embarrassed to have taken my friends in here.
This used to be the place to go.
Not anymore.
The toilets were dirty and the seats were broken.
The only positive was the staff were friendly and polite but they seemed untrained for their roles, this isn‚Äôt their fault though.
There was an older lady on the bar who was really lovely and helpful.
In conclusion, please don‚Äôt waste your time or money on this this dated place.
There are much better options available in Liverpool.
I wish I‚Äôd picked one of them instead.
Food was nice and staffs were friendly but the place and vibe was a let down.. tiny and quiet restaurant.
Very nice restaurant within the Hilton Hotel Liverpool.
Good food and decent entertainment too.
Drinks are expensive but then they always are in these places so no surprises really...!
We went for afternoon tea but it was a huge letdown.
When we got there, the Liverpool game was on and it was very loud.
We sat down in our booth and the tea cups all had lipstick on the rim even though they were supposed to be "clean."
We ended up leaving and not having tea, what an embarrassing excuse for tea.
Really lovely food.
We had a Groupon voucher so it was really good value.
Nice restaurant and great waiters.
Only slight snag was the salsa lesson going on in the bar area, and as there's no separation wall it ended up being a bit noisy.....would have preferred not to have had to sit through that, I was not aware when booking that it would be on otherwise I would have booked for a different time so we could have had a quieter meal.
Possibly people should be made aware of things like this when booking.
Other than that great, but if I was to come again it would have to be when there's no salsa lessons!!
!
Good food.
Fast friendly service.
Nice view out over Liverpool towards lime Street station.
On the second floor so views are not as spectacular as from the 8th floor but still gives feeling of space in the city centre.
There is a bar and a 24/7 cafe bar.
Comfortable seating for informal snacks and drinks.
Tables of various sizes for singles, couples, families and groups.
Breakfast buffet is one of the best.
Fruit yoghurt cereal pastries and hot cooked English breakfast.
Also open long hours.
‚ÄèYou can't believe how warm they were, as you may know, sockets in the UK are different from other countries, and we needed to charge our devices, they fully assisted us and found one for us however they could say go out and buy.
‚ÄèThe breakfast was lovely, view was also amazing, and you had plenty of choices.
‚ÄèThanks for all.
We were for breakfast, it was delicious English breakfast, the atmosphere was friendly so I decided to work here!
The people here are beyond helpful, I didn‚Äôt have English plug in, they helped me to find, even one working here borrowed his phones charger‚Äôs.
If I would be in Liverpool again absolutely here is the 1st destination to get the positive energy from people around and take the city tour üòá
Top class restaurant - reasonably priced breakfast with a great selection of both tasty & healthy food
Delicious food n lovely friendly staff üòã
It's a gem, delivering authentic Italian flavors through standout pasta dishes, fresh seafood, and expertly grilled options.
The warm ambiance and attentive staff make it a top choice for a delightful dining experience in the heart of the city.
We enjoyed the seafood spaghetti, lamb chops, and lasagna, all of which were absolutely amazing.
However, the milk cake for dessert fell short of expectations.
Beautiful decor, and lovely food.
I was a bit disappointed with my main but not because of the cooking I just didn‚Äôt really like the sauce on my chicken it‚Äôs an acquired taste.
I had the breaded chicken with Parma ham and mozzarella.
My partner loved his which was the chicken and red wine and my 5 year old son demolished his creamy ham pasta.
The starters was beautiful my partner and I shared the homemade soup which was minestrone and bruschetta 10/10.
Will definitely return.
Love the dessert trolley in there my son had a strawberry tart quite pricey though but well worth it.
Great food!
We had the Calamari for starter, and the Tournedos Rossini and the Tagliatelle Con Funghi for mains and then desserts and we genuinely can‚Äôt complain about anything at all it was so good!
Service was fast and it was a very nice comfortable meal!
We stopped by at this amazing Italian restaurant on a weeknight, and we were not disappointed.
The restaurant was busy, but we got a table and were sitted immediately.
Drinks, starters, and our mains all arrived onetime Food was cooked to perfection.
It was fresh, good-sized portions, and very tasty.
The dessert trolley is an amazing idea, you get to see the dessert portions straight away and order as many as you like.
Dessert was also lovely.
We all had an amazing evening and would definitely go back, if in Liverpool City Centre for dinner.
really good atmosphere, the service is nice.
Strongly recommend lamb rib, very delicious.
Always delicious with great service.
Slightly delayed an starter, but without asking, they gave us two cocktails.
We both had Crab Maison followed by Fish Stew.
Freshly made so happy with any delay.
Lovely wine  and finished with some chocolates for mother's day üòã
Love the vibes in this restaurant, I usually come here for desserts and coffee and sometimes food.
I think they should improve their coffee-making skills & add more desserts on the menu because there are not many choices.
The service is cool, the staff was a tall man he was kind and whenever I come I only like to ask him for service!
Visited on 17/02/2024.
arrived shortly before 9PM to be turned away by the manager ( Donna ) she stated no tables were available for the remaining duration.
despite empty tables being visible.
my friend and I went to a coffee shop and checked the availability online.
tables were available from 9PM.
I booked the table online and returned to the restaurant.
Donna was confused regarding tables being available on the website.
and stated she would have to remove the breakfast menu from the table.
I was confused by this comment.
despite the strange start to our visit.
Donna was friendly and helpful.
it was our first time visiting as I‚Äôve heard good things about the restaurant.
I ordered the C√¥te Burger with fries.
and my friend opted for Sea Bream Nantais.
the burger was delicious, the fries were slightly overcooked.
Donna took our order, a different waiter brought the food and collected the payment.
the most important part of the hospitality service was left out - No one came to check if everything was fine with the food.
in no rush to return
Lovely restaurant but the steak is totally over cooked, maybe we should order something else
The food was really good here.
The staff were helpful and friendly.
I really enjoyed my meal.
It did get very noisy which I admit I found off-putting but it was simply the number of people talking (a busy Friday night) rather than loud music or anything.
I would happily visit again but probably only at a less busy time.
The apple tart tatain was amazing.
My go to restaurant in Liverpool.
Have been many times and have never been disappointed with the service or the quality of food.
The prices are beyond reasonable and the portion sizes are very generous.
Definitely deserves more recognition as when we go it‚Äôs hardly busy even though it should be but I can‚Äôt complain about that.
Everyone should give this a try it‚Äôs a bit away from the centre but worth the walk.
Also gave a free cake for my birthday and was a very tasty cake.
We came here for a work Christmas meal, about 20 of us, the owner was so accommodating especially when we had a few drop out and few more join last minute!
The food was delicious!
They prepared starters for us of the chefs choice, our mains which everyone struggled to finish they were very generous portions and some gorgeous sharing desserts!
Amazing staff also, really great place couldnt recommend more
Food was very nice and tasted fresh the only downside is the waiting staff seem very disinterested and I had to wait over 40 minutes for someone to take my order I can understand if the restaurant was busy but only 2 tables of 3 and over a 40 minute wait with 2 members off staff is unacceptable.
The food was absolutely amazing.
The meats were cooked to perfection.
The service was great.
Would highly recommend this place.
Great halal place that is alcohol free.
I ordered a Lamb Basha, felafel and a hot tea.
The felafel were big and fresh, the Lamb basha instead was very poor portion, just 3 small pieces and even though the sauce was hot, the meat was cold inside.
The price is good, felafel good, but for the love of God make it fresh or warm it up properly and maybe 2-3 more pieces because the portion was too small.
The service was 10/10 and so was the atmosphere.
The staff were lovely and well composed.
The food was nice but I feel it wasn‚Äôt 100% authentic, I feel the flavours have been lessened to attract a wider range of people, which is fine I guess.
However the taste was not issue and was worth the money.
I got ‚ÄúWorker‚Äôs Tiffin‚Äù which was a good way to taste test a good amount of the menu.
Office workers tiffin set menu for two ¬£25pp üòÄ.
At first I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be enough food, but as I was halfway through the main, I was definitely filling up!
The Fenugreek Kissed Fries are 10/10 üçü.
The kitchen gives you a variety of currys (2 meat and 1 veg) so everyone at the table who shared a set menu had a different curry to you.
The roti was quite bland and didn‚Äôt have the buttery ghee taste but I enjoyed the rest of the main ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
The brownie was cold for me as I prefer a warm gooey brownie, however the vanilla ice cream was lovely üç®‚Ä¶ mango smoothie was nice as well ü•≠‚Ä¶ defo recommend the set menu if you‚Äôre unsure of what to get üòä!
!
This place serves really tasty Indian street  food in a beautiful location.
It was very busy, so we had to book.
The food was fantastic, really good quality but it's not cheap here.
Also, it's worth being aware that they automatically add the tip on for you with the bill.
They tell you this, so you can have it taken off if you prefer, but most people would feel too awkward and this is what they're relying on, right?
As someone who has worked as a waitress and always leaves a tip, unless the service is really poor, I find this a bit presumptuous.
I'd rather be left to leave a rip of my own choosing at my own discretion.
Enjoyed a delicious meal at Mowgli in Bold Street.
We had a variety of small plates - as a vegetarian the yoghurt chat bombs and tamarind fries were my absolute favourite.
My daughter and friend both hd chicken dishes that they loved.
Each plate comes out as and when it‚Äôs ready ‚Ä¶ not necessarily all in one go‚Ä¶ so be prepared.
Service was very good, staff all very engaging and polite.
Definitely book as this place was absolutely full throughout our time there.
Looking for somewhere to eat in Liverpool.
Google suggested Mowgli.
Visited the Birmingham restaurant and loved the food so, off we trotted.
Got a seat (well .. a swing) and ordered our food.
No complaints, good turnaround between order and food arriving.
Tastes were amazing and we left feeling full and content.
We will be back.
Another visit to Bistro Franc and as per usual the food and service were great.
Friendly attentive staff, helpful with menu choices and wine pairings.
We had three courses and each dish was a delight.
Highly recommend their Duck and Dauphinoise main course - perfectly cooked and full of flavour.
Their Steak main course was also a winner.
If you're a sticky Toffee Pudding person then you can add ice-cream And custard if you ask nicely !
This is one of many visits here and love that the food is consistently good.
Great value for money too.
Fantastic food and staff!!
In a nutshell - perfect texture and temperature of food with beautiful balance of flavours, further accompanied by a fantastic team!
Entr√©e - BOULETTES DE POULET Chicken meatballs were cooked with a subtle herbal aroma, served with a tomato compote topped salad and of course, slices of baguette.
The compote was spot on with its slight spiciness that works well with the creamy chicken.
Plat - FILET DE MERLU PO√äL√â Hake was fried to perfect texture and the scallops were just the best I‚Äôve ever had!
Imagine running the knife with minimal resistance when cutting it.
Cauliflower pur√©e was airy and creamy and topped with chorizo crumbs enriching the flavours.
Legume - RATATOUILLE I couldn‚Äôt help but to endeavour an extra course following the brilliant compote.
Modest plating served with cous cous (I‚Äôve cutoff some cous cous as the main was very filling) may make one underestimate this classic dish, however a burst of richness and freshness will prove the otherwise.
They did it right!!
Dessert - CR√àME BR√õL√âE Beautifully caramelised malt sugar brought richness in flavour for this classic.
Best texture I‚Äôve ever had in the Northwest - slightly runny and crisp.
This variation features a kick of citrus that balances the sweetness.
Cointreau added combined the flavours together in an impeccable harmony.
Staff Shout out sp√©ciale to Javier, who was so friendly, knowledgeable and has given me great recommendations - wine pairing was spot on!
The whole experience was further elevated with my pleasure meeting the head chef!
All the staff I‚Äôve meet was exceptionally helpful and kind.
I‚Äôm very grateful to this great team.
Food was great and service was amazing!
Melissa our waitress was really friendly and attentive !
Will definitely come back!
Thank you !
üòç
A great French restaurant.
We took the special deal which is 2 courses plus ¬Ω bottle of wine each.
Excellent value for great food.
My fish (sea bass) was cooked to perfection.
This was the first time we'd been seated up on the balcony and it's great up there, looking down on the main floor.
Amazing food, hospitality and service was outstanding from Eugen and the rest of Staff / Team üëç
Excellent BBQ restaurant.
Been on my list to visit for a very long time, but just had not got round to it.
Glad I finally made it.
It was a Saturday night, so very busy.
We were able to get a seat just fine however and ordered a drink and our meal relativelt quickly, despite the busyness!
The food was excellent, well presented and cooked right through.
We ordered the USS Wisconsin platter for 2, there was a mountain of food - and we ordered extra fries, which were unnecessary!).
The burgers were fantastic, and the food well cooked without being overdone or charred.
I have never had pit bean before so that was something new.
We were too full after this for a dessert but not disappointed as the meal was spot on.
Will definitely be visiting again.
Came here on a Wednesday evening and was left disappointed with the food and the speed of service.
Note the staff were very friendly.
Once we were seated, we waited around 20 minutes before our order was taken.
I went for the wings with it being wing Wednesday and was told I had 1 and a half hours to eat as many as I liked.
This sounds a lot, but given it then took 30 mins for the first bowl to arrive, and then a subsequent 30 mins for the second bowƒ∫, you're not going to go over the top with them.
Admittedly, the bowl is 12 half wings, so a good amount per bowl.
They are also fried, which I was saddened to see, as I thought this was meant to be a smokehouse, and smoked wings are a lot nicer than fried.
Fried meant I was feeling a bit sickly after the second bowl, so I stopped there.
I also didn't find them overly flavoursome, I could mainly taste the grease.
My partner went for the prawns, and the burnt end mash.
Maybe an oversight on our part, but the prawns came fried, not grilled, so she really didn't enjoy them and didn't finish them.
The burnt ends were like rubber.
We couldn't cut them, never mind chew them.
We did complain about these, and they were taken off the bill, which we appreciated.
Overall, our experience wasn't the best, and we won't be heading back.
Me and my friend arrived without booking, but staff were quick to seat us and take our order.
Atmosphere of the place certainly added too the fun of the experience that we had here, as it felt very relaxed and old western American in aesthetic.
We were feeling particularly hungry so ordered our meal with our eyes, portion wise we were definitely more than happy.
Meat was very tender and warm, staff were happy to oblige with requests to add extra marinade to our items.
Although beef rib initially came overcooked staff were quick to fix this and apologise bringing me a fresh one, tasting warm, juicy and very flavourful!
It should be noted however staff made a mistake with our order and added an extra side of plain fries to it that we were charged for, although my friend had not requested it with his burger.
Pulled pork, extra hot chicken pieces, beef brisket and the rib are all must tries in terms of the seasoning and flavour (not being bland at all), our meats were cooked well too our taste also.
Aside from the meat the loaded fries, red dog sauce and buffalo sauce tasted absolutely fantastic paired with the other items hot from the grill.
Not to mention the coleslaw, which although I prefer a more peppery one in contrast to this creamy one still tastes great in our experience here.
It would be rude of me not to mention how if you‚Äôre coming here their Oreo shake is a must try.
Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit if you like Western USA themed food as you typically get tasty meat options paired with a chill dining experience here, which I don‚Äôt tend to see frequently anywhere else in the city.
In terms of trying too pull off a USA themed place when it comes to the food and vibe, red dog comes out as one of, if not the closest in Liverpool in achieving that.
First time trying this American smoker restaurant.
We ordered the Uss Oregon platter.
Its had wings,sausages,pulled pork,brisket,pork ribs slaw and pickles.
Also had the Mac and cheese.
All were perfectly cooked and full of flavor.
Maybe too full for my taste buds but still mouthwatering!
Service was good but running a bit late to bring the food.
Notice the place was packed full on a Friday night.
Now price wise its a bit expensive but its worth a try for sure
Best BBQ outside of the USA that I've ever had, and I've tried many UK BBQ restaurants.
Service was great and the beer came in huge frosted glasses, which was a nice touch.
Melty brisket, fall-apart ribs, succulent sausage, brilliant buffalo wings, perfectly pulled pork, beautiful blood sausage and superb sides.
Shame I'm not a LIverpool local, or I'd be there regularly!
Fabulous food!
The menu has a great selection, and the staff were really friendly.
One of the best Italian restaurants in Liverpool, I definitely recommend going!
Had a lovely meal.
Beautiful restaurant and staff were very attentive.
All foods were amazingly tasty.
Especially carbonara was the best in Liverpool!
They also have lots of drink selections to enjoy.
It was busy Saturday evening but all staff were friendly and helpful.
Good find and highly recommend this place.
I really like this restaurant, I actually chose it to celebrate my birthday this year, and the celebration cake is soooo good!
So last Thursday (14th)when I been here again I ordered this cake again, it was still so delicious.
Then I asked a extra one for takeaway.
After around 10mins later a lady seems like manager told me ‚ÄúWE DO NOT DO TAKEAWAY‚Äù.
But interestingly, I just found in google it shows you do takeaway!
It made me feel very UNCOMFORTABLE and I felt like I was being treated differently.
I even love this place so much but get treated like that?
I'm waiting for the restaurant to give me a reasonable explanation
Fun spot for a great Italian meal.
Food was excellent.
The atmosphere might be a bit crowded and noisy for some but not for most!
Service was good although the night we went was very busy and it looked like they could have had additional staff as items took longer than expected.
In the end, üçùüçùüçùüçùüçùpasta was üëçüëçüëçüëç
Great authentic Thai food, lots of options to choose from the menus.
Dined here a few times now for both lunch and dinner during a busy period and the quality of the food is consistently good.
Highly recommend.
Absolutely amazing experience at Spice Thai.
I got their vegetable spring rolls to start and they were prepared very well.
Very standard rolls but they were tasty all the same.
My main was their 3 meat heaven dish which consists of roast duck, char siu (roast pork) and crispy pork belly (along with rice and vegetables).
It's no exaggeration to say this was some of the most flavourful and enjoyable meat I've ever had.
The pork and duck skin were crispy and all the meat was tender and succulent.
I considered buying a second serving to take home because eating it once didn't feel like enough.
Any time I'm in Liverpool this restaurant will be my first stop!
10/10.
Ordered Pad Thai, steamed rice, fried dumplins, and vegetable tempura.
Everything was delicious.
The staff was friendly and attentive.
Lovely place !
Went on a Saturday night and it was buzzing so I‚Äôd definitely recommend booking !
The food was very good, came quickly and excellent quality The service was great the staff really helping where they could Only thing I would say was that it was Smokey in the building and so could benefit from some extractor fans !
!
It‚Äôs a little pricey but seems to be the norm at the moment otherwise lovely place would highly recommend
Spice Thai nailed it on all fronts!
The food was seriously amazing, service was on point, and the atmosphere just made the whole vibe perfect.
Totally exceeded expectations ‚Äì hands down, my go-to spot now.
You've won me over completely!
I wouldn't say it's close to good Italian food you will find in Italy, but it's okay.
3 stars perfectly represents it.
It was group booking, and we had to wait 17 minutes extra to be seated even with booking.
Wouldn't recommend Linquine Di Marre(seafood pasta one) as we had to send it back twice for being too watery.
Pizza is basic.
Deserts were delicious.
I first came here on impulse with my husband for his birthday‚Ä¶ beginning of November first impressions did it for us great service gave plenty of time between courses‚Ä¶ nothing was to much trouble we then returned just on a week later same great food same great service Carl was one of our servers lovely guy‚Ä¶.
Would highly recommend
First time visiting the Liverpool restaurant of this chain.
Nice, clean setting and friendly staff.
Tried two new items on the menu, the wilted spinach, potato, crispy Parma ham and chicken salad was very nice although not very filling so had the sticky toffee, coffee pudding too!
At first I was disappointed at the size of the portions but it was very rich.
It was fairly quiet for lunchtime not sure if it was because the restaurant is in an elevated position by the bus station.
Nevertheless it was reasonably priced and we would go again
Best Italian food in town.
Ordered  pizza and spaghetti üçù.
Both tasted very good.
Tiramisu was also good üî•üòã Great atmosphere and good service.
It‚Äôs ok but felt calzone portion small and raw in the thicker parts.
The waiters were nice and friendly.
Location is good but place needs some refurbishment as felt a bit worn now and cold.
We had a fabulous time at the restaurant as a group of student nurses .
The Christmas menu is amazing and the staff were really attentive.
Make sure you use blue light !

Worst ever seafood risotto I have ever had in my life.
Dry and not creamy, not Al dente, didn‚Äôt add any white wine judging from the taste, almost zero olive oil and I suspect they just boiled the rice done and mixed it with seafood (tiny shrimp and squid and a few small mussels boiled again with most of the taste more or less gone).
Sorry to criticize so much as I believe the chef can do much better like many others who I have come across cooking fantastic dishes.
Excellent meal on mothers day with wife, daughter & 2 grandchildren.
Excellent food & service youngest is dairy free, and he enjoyed his vegan pizza.
Staff were lovely and will definitely  be back
First time I‚Äôve been an everything was absolutely amazing from start to finish!
Our server Katie was lovely and attentive, nothing was too much!
The food was delicious and will definitely be back soon!
Amazing experience from start to finish!!!
Anthony our waiter for the night was outstanding!!
Thanks very much for a great night!
We will be back soon!
You are an asset to the restaurant and you certainly made it an evening for my wife's birthday!
One we won't forget!!
Thanks!!
!
Came here after work today to grab some dinner, decided to sit in as it was empty.
It may have been empty to sit in but there were plenty of people coming in to order takeout and the service was very quick - that is a good sign.
The lady on the till was very polite and friendly with customers, even saying goodbye to people leaving.
The food was lovely.
The mega box is quite large so for anyone wondering if the portions are small, I'd say they aren't.
Especially since it is also quite filling.
The quality of the food is lovely.
I had the black pepper beef noodle box, the ingredients were fresh and the meat was quite nice.
Usually I'm fussy on meat so pleasantly suprised by how nice it was.
Definitely worth a trip, for what you get and the quality, the price is suitable I would say.
My only regret is I mumbled a good bye and didn't think to thank the staff for their lovely service and food (too busy in pondering what I'll order next time!
ü§£) so please accept this as my thanks!
We've been loyal customers of this noodle bar since day one, and it has truly become our go-to spot for a delightful lunch experience.
The consistently exceptional service and mouthwatering noodle dishes keep us coming back time and again.
Highly recommended!
üíØüçú
This is honestly one of the best noodles I‚Äôve ever had, I always go for the Naga noodles, it‚Äôs spicy but delicious; if u can‚Äôt handle the spice don‚Äôt go for it, the staff are so lovely and welcoming.
I LOVE IT!
I had the Malay Rice and my partner had the special.
I personally liked the rice, there were quite a bit of shrimp and not a lot of chicken.
My partners meal was slightly burnt though.
Its my second time coming here but I dont remember much about the first time however have heard prices has increased and size has been reduced.
Overall, the staff were ok.
The place is perfect, very good quality food, with a quality products, real Chinese kitchen, a lot staff in a very clean kitchen , sweet and spicy noodles are my favourite, in city centre, totally recommended.
Regular box and Mega box just for a extra ¬£pound.
This is my first time to have dinner at Hee Kee.
It is surprisingly good.
Their menu has a lot of choices.
We ordered a seafood meal for 4-6 people.
This meal includes 2 seafood dishes and 4 normal dishes,a total of 6 dishes and only cost us ¬£8x.xx.
Rice and soup are self served with unlimited refilled.
Each portion is generously large.
What‚Äôs great about it is that you can eat different variety of food here, such as stirred fried garlic and chilli prawn (tai pai don style), siu mei and Sichuan cuisine, the chefs there must be very professional, I can rarely found a restaurant in hk with many variety of dishes in 1 restaurant.
The food is fresh and the portions are tasty and generous.
E.g.
there are 10pieces of prawn in 1 dish, a large sea bass, big bowl of sichun chilli and spicy belly pork.
In general, the food is authentic hk styled flavour, delicious and the quality is very high.
A must go restaurant when you visit Liverpool, highly recommended.
Had an authentic and satisfying meal at Hee Kee.
Staff members were extremely kind and accommodating.
Both food and drink were excellent, and I was even given a complimentary tong sui (sweet soup) at the end.
Really would love to come back for some dim sum and fried rice.
Highly recommended for those seeking Cantonese food, as well as those interested in discovering more about Hong Kong culture because you will be immersed in Cantopop played inside the restaurant!
Have come here a few times and i like the food.
Staff were very nice and helpful.
I ordered the beef with broccoli and my partner ordered char siu and the best thing is that you get free rice and soup serviced in the restaurant.
We paid ¬£26.80 for everything
They charge ¬£12.90 for this...  Crispy Chilli Beef on Rice.
The beef and sauce was nice, I'd normally give an extra star for taste alone but but the portions were obviously awful.
Rice was nothing special.
Packaging was awful, leaked everywhere out these cheap polystyrene containers.
Did not follow any order notes, including did not provide cutlery (one pictured is from my backups).
I got this as a 2-4-1 offer and I still feel scammed.
Had a very pleasant meal here.
Extremely friendly service.
All the dishes were so generously portioned and on point.
Would 120% recommend this place!
Very nice and friendly staff.
Excellent food.
Atmosphere would have been 5 but for the trio of drunken, foul mouthed blaring morons present.
Fortunately these decanted about 20 minutes after my wife arrived.
Great views over the Mersey and nice rooftop terrace.
Will be very happy to visit again.
We just finished the river mersey cruise and we saw this resto from the river.
It‚Äôs overlooking the river.
We decided to celebrate vday lunch here.
Me and my 11 and 13 yr old kids.
We enjoyed the food!
It was a bit expensive but the portions are big (i was expecting them to be small) and ambiance is truly nice, we sat by the window overlooking the river.
The spareribs were huge and we loved the taste!
Crunchy but tender and so flavorful.
Duck salad and the Salmon with noodle are good too!
Highly recommended.
Came here for a meal with my girlfriend last weekend.
Amazing food, great service.
Well worth the price.
Will definitely be returning here even if only coming to Liverpool to go here
Fantastic food and good service !
View over the Mersey is fabulous .
Love the Pangang Curry and chocolate cake with ice cream
Another great meal in this lovely pan Asian restaurant!
We visit Matou each time we are in Liverpool and love the food, the atmosphere and the beautiful views out over the Mersey.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you like your food spicy or plain, there‚Äôs lots to choose from in the extensive menu.
My friend recommended to me few days ago that the seafood in this restaurant is very good, so I came here to try this restaurant.
When we arrived at 6 p.m., there were not many customers in the restaurant.
I ordered 4 Scottish oysters and a mussel as starter, a seafood tomato pasta as a main course.
I tried 4 different ways to eat 4 oysters: eat them directly, add lemon juice, add chili sauce, add chili garlic sauce, I think adding lemon juice is the best.
The mussels are very fresh, but not as good as the one I ate at Southport last time, but for 10¬£.
a large size of fresh mussels is pretty good.
There are many types of seafood in the seafood pasta.
I can find shrimp, sea bass, octopus legs and squid in it.
However, the linguine used for the pasta were a little for hold the sauce.
It would be better if it was replaced with tagliatelle.
In short, I think this restaurant is very good as a seafood restaurant and the price is not expensive.
It deserves to be on my must-eat list in Liverpool.
Totally I spent for the meal I ate is 49.28¬£.
A hidden gem.
We found "Cargo Seafood" online whilst searching for a seafood restaurant to visit in Liverpool.
It's a little further away from all the restaurants by the docks, so it made for a nice evening walk.
On arrival, we were greeted nicely by a friendly team and shown to our tables.
As it was a weekday, the place was a bit quiet.
Food and drinks all arrived on time, fresh and very lovely.
Good portions, too We all had amazing meals and will definitely recommend this place and hopefully visit again in the near future.
The Seabass meal, seafood pasta, and King prawns were a few of our favourites üòç
This place is truly a hidden gem!!
The food was perfectly cooked and super fresh, we ordered the seafood platter for two for lunch and it was an absolute divine!
Highly recommended.
I think the service was a bit slow at the beginning maybe they were understaffed but really, the staff were super nice and friendly.
There was a construction site blocking the sea view outside, but nevertheless our experience was 10/10!!
Definitely going again!
What a great dinnerüòç  I particularly like the scallop dish, which goes so well with the sauce.
The lobster is so good.
I‚Äôm pretty sure I heard is whisper ‚Äúeat me‚ÄùüòÇü§£üòÑ And the chef very attentive and the lobster claws were already opened.
And the side dish of potato chips is a must.
It‚Äôs really, really good!
But the seafood cocktail shrimp was a bit salty.
Lovely restaurant a little out of the way at far northern end of Docks.
The food was beautifully made, dished up and tasted great.
I had the monkfish and prawns.
The manager and waitress were very pleasant and kind.
I was worried whether one of the dishes I ordered had something I was allergic to in it.
They went out of their way to check and double check with the chef to reassure me.
First time dining here 14/12.
The waiting staff and bar staff here are amazing.
Really good service and nice food.
They made our dining experience a good one.
I recommend this place and will be revisiting again.
So food was ok, was told unable to use cash or pay on card as only allow 5 transactions per group but only told at the end.
My friend ordered vegan curry and was given chicken.
Presentation or food was good but overall starter was very bland in flavour was disappointed
Have eaten here several times.
My friend and I ate here Saturday 2/3/24.
Had pre booked for 10.45.
The food as always was great.
We both had Bill's Brunch which was lovely.
The reason I am writing is that every member of staff was exceptional.
They are friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble .
They are always busy here but we were not rushed and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
A big Well Done to all your staff.
I have a great birthday breakfast with my husband,service was quick food was tasty.
The restaurant was clean and spacious üëåüèæ
From walking in to leaving the staff can‚Äôt do enough for you.
So friendly and welcoming.
Due to how fantastic the staff were we attended twice on the same day on our short break.
Fantastic food and would 100% recommend.
Such a lovely team
Took awhile before we got to order and about 40 minutes till we got our starters.
We ordered the start platter and really enjoyed the mix of items and how tasty they were.
We also really enjoyed our mains and being Thai ourselves we enjoyed how authentic tasting the food was.
Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
Recently, I've made this splendid venue a staple for my monthly networking gatherings.
Intrigued by their tantalizing menu, I decided it was time to indulge after some shopping.
Opting for lighter portions, my partner savored the Grilled Sea Bass Fillets, while I opted for the Crispy Chicken with Cashew Nuts.
We complemented our meals with Coconut Rice and Five Spice Fries.
In short, the experience was nothing short of culinary excellence ‚Äì every bite was a delight.
We left feeling satisfyingly full, having polished off our plates and a pint of Thai beer to round off the meal.
A special nod to Joel for his top-notch service ‚Äì truly first class.
We're already looking forward to our next visit, with eyes set on the Sharing Platters.
A gastronomic gem worth revisiting!
üëçüèº
It had been quite some time since my last visit, but today I had the pleasure of returning to this lovely establishment for a Networking Lunch.
I must say, the service was impeccable, even when I accidentally knocked over and shattered a glass of orange juice - they handled it with grace.
Now, let's talk about the food; I'll let my photos speak for themselves.
Each dish was a feast for the eyes, and I can assure you it tasted just as delicious as it looked.
I also rediscovered the delightful flavors of Thai beers during my visit.
In the spirit of research, I tried two different bottles, and they did not disappoint.
üòã I wholeheartedly recommend this place, and I can't wait to come back for a full meal with all the delicious trimmings.
It's an experience you won't want to miss!
Absolutely divine place!
The staff are so friendly and hospitable,  the food and drinks are delicious and so authentic!
Booked a table for myself and my husband recently for dinner.
This being the second time but the first time was for lunch and I can only say that the service and food were amazing on both occasions!
Thank you for treating us to a lovely evening.
We will be returning soon.
10/10
This is the second branch I have been too.
The restaurant does not disappoint.
The service is truly amazing.
All the staff are very friendly.
The food isn‚Äôt too expensive either when compared to other restaurant  We went for dinner, it was very busy but we did not wait too long for the food.
There is no onsite parking, you would have to park in one of the near car parks.
Over priced, underserviced.
Stayed at the hotel with work, Got back to the hotel at least 45 mins before the restaurant closed, had to go the the reception to get them to call up to the restaurant as I'd been waiting with no sign of service.
When I did get served I was over charged for the menu item (see photos)  The guy that brought my meal was spot but the restaurant bar person and serving staff were inadequate, to top it off, for one main and one drink it was almost ¬£40....
I thought the drink pushed it up...but it was the meal...check out the recipt and the menu in the photos.
Nonidrea where the rocket was or maybe the caramelised onions if going for the fillet (not what i asked for) but worher way, neither were listed as ¬£ 31.25.
Will not be staying or eating here again.
Not surprised there were only 2 tables taken.
Comfy modern, limited menu but very tasty, friendly staff and a great bar.
Really bad experience.
Has the fish and chips.
The oil was obviously too hot burning the batter but leaving the fish undercooked.
Sent it back and received a poor one in return.
The veg curry was good though.
The server was apologetic but didn't do anything about it especially when said a second time the food wasn't that great.
Limited menu and not cheap but good quality food.
Horrible food.
Sorry, but really horrible.
To be honest I wasn't sure about dining here following the comments of a close friend who had visited a couple of weeks ago.
However my daughter wanted to go for her birthday so who am I to argue?
I have walked passed here a few times but I had never noticed just how big it is, likewise the decor in the restaurant is more homely than the front bar area.
The six of us were a bit late for our booking but we had a very nice welcome and were shown to our booth.
Thursday night and the place was full, I was therefore expecting that the food and service would be slow but I couldn't fault it.
Irma looked after us and she was excellent.
Nothing wrong with the food either although I do prefer my chips to be served without salt, similarly the spinach was a bit salty.
6 meals and all were happy with what they had.
We found room for desserts and enjoyed those too.
All in all a very enjoyable evening.
The restaurant space is well presented and the staff are friendly and accommodating, but the food was average at best.
Several dishes served to my party were barely warm; one was cold and only one arrived truly hot.
The aubergine parmigiana ravioli had little taste.
However, the plate presentation was good.
And, the cocktails were well mixed.
I had a work team lunch here, and it was lovely.
I loved and finished every single dish I ordered.
Really warm and nice ambience also.
Friendly and nice service.
I'll definitely be going back there on a date soon!
Was a nice meal out, felt the music was a bit loud in the bar.
It was quieter in the dinning area but still a little too loud for us as a family to enjoy a meal.
Loved my sisters meal.
They had there own Gluten Free menu, which was great for my brother.
I went to Riva Blu for a long overdue reunion with a family member.
I couldn't recommend it enough as the selection and variety of wine and food was ample.
Furthermore, the food was cooked perfectly and a great wine (Try the Brunello!)
made it a night to remember.
Visited Locanta for some dinner.
It was quite early so we were the only customers.
We were welcomed by a friendly staff member and got seated.
The menu offers a good variety of Italian dishes.
The Caprese salad was beautiful with fresh tomatoes and good mozzarella.
Tried the pat√© as well which was lovely.
The calamari were tasty as well.
For mains went for the beef stroganoff which in my opinion lacked a bit of flavour, needed some salt as well.
Other main was sizzling steak with peppercorn sauce, the steak was cooked beautifully.
For sides had some garlic bread and another caprese salad.
Everything arrived quickly, apart from the garlic bread which might've been forgotten but the staff quickly got it ordered and it arrived a few minutes later.
Overall very nice experience with simple comfort food, but very tasty.
Came here on a Tuesday lunch.
Service was very friendly.
Portion sizes were very good.
Would go here again for Italian food
First time visiting for a special dinner with hubby.
Food was fresh and delicious.
Service was first class and you could tell they take pride in serving you well.
We were even given a complimentary dessert.
Felt really special, thank you.
Chicken was halal so it was lovely to experience authentic Italian for us.
After around 4 years, I came back here for some authentic Itallian food.
It was just as great as it was 4 years back, I will certainly be coming back again soon as there are a few more dishes I want to try.
We had a veg sharing platter, 2 side plates (2 starter type dishes), and 2 mains each.
Of course, we faltered once we'd got through all of that and half of our mains, and we ended up taking our remaining meal home with us.
The ambience was nice and relaxed, and the food was well presented and very tasty.
My personal favourite was the baked funghi and chilli side dish I had.
That was sublime, I could eat that as a main with some sourdough bread to dip in its sauce.
Overall, it's definitely worth a try.
It's nice for friends meeting up, work dinners or couples just wanting a nice meal.
Thanks Locanta and see you again soon.
Visited with friends for Xmas meal.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Having a good range of Mediterranean foods in the menu.
It was busiest time of year that's why mind waiting for your meal.
There is nothing wrong with the food and tastes good, but it may not be delicious enough for me.
I have to say that the service is really good.
All the employees are very friendly.
Just now, my girlfriend spilled beer on the ground.
The manager gave me a new bottle and dried the floor.
We feel respected and friendly.
We are really grateful to him.
His kindness makes us feel warm!
Food here is always fresh and yummy.
Service is a bit slow.
We ordered to collect, and on website we choose our collection time.
When we came we had to wait 20 additional minutes and ask two different people for our food.
Restaurant seemed clean and tidy.
The last time I came 2017 when it was open new but service was not great but I been last Saturday.Nice place to go to eat with family and friends.
Customer service was fabulous.
Diogo is great.
He took my order and was very helpful.
Great custom service from him.
I can't say my experience was amazing like other Nando's restaurants.
Service was the worst I had, waited 55min for food in a place that was not even half full.
No check up after receiving the food...
I recommend finding a different place to eat.
Absolutely unacceptable experience at Nando‚Äôs in Bullring!
The service was outrageously slow, and my disgust peaked when I witnessed a staff member carelessly handling food with bare fingers.
Hygiene standards are not just lacking but appalling.
This negligence is unacceptable and tarnishes the entire dining experience.
Immediate action and serious improvement are imperative for the sake of customers‚Äô health and satisfaction.
Best Indian food in the city centre.
Wild thing is, service is so quick no matter how packed the restaurant is.
Their design is beautiful and the staff are always there to help with the menu as can get a bit complicated for me.
Their curries are one of the best in Birmingham.
Been there with work mates and with with freinds and on both occasions the service is excellent
Great food!!!
We went for a special occasion and although I kept changing my reservation time, the team were understanding and supportive.
It was absolutely packed when we went on a Tuesday night.
Hard to get hold of someone when we needed additional drinks.
A shame they didn‚Äôt take my request into consideration.
Overall, great food great visit and would go again.
Went here for two celebrations in the last month and the food is devine!
The service was a bit slow but on one occasion they were a bit busy.
Their mocktails were nice too (a tad bit too sweet for me but they were happy to top it up with soda water).
I would definitely visit again though to try their other food!
Lovely food!
As a curry lover was so impressed with this place, was very busy but we were seated fairly quickly after a nice pint at the bar.
Had a selection of dishes, the tama chips are to die for & the curries were fantastic.
Had a railway lamb & a homestyle chicken curry, both were so tasty.
Will definitely be back.
Loved the place and the ambience.
Great atmosphere and lovely staff.
They were courteous and polite.
We went for the vegetarian options and had Paneer Makhani which was absolutely delicious.
The portion size was perfect and was good enough for two of us.
It came with 2 naans.
We ordered 1 set of roti separately and it was sufficient for us given the portion size.
Cheese chilli balls were perfect too.
Only this much kept us full for a long time and we were surprised that how only this much food kept us full.
üòÅ  I would highly recommend this place if you want to have Indian food which was quite authentic.
This chicken burger is possibly the most amazing I've ever tasted!
The edgy atmosphere, friendly staff, and genuinely life-changing food make it a must-visit.
The burgers hit a nostalgic note but are a whole new level.
The flavors are incredible, with a crispy, delightful batter.
Highly recommend ‚Äì I'll be returning for sure!
Wow, wanted to try this place for a while and I don't know why I waited so long.
This is the most tender and juicy chicken burger I have ever had.
Got the Christmas special and the brie on the burger worked extremely well.
Chips and wings were also really good.
Staff were also polite and we were seen to quickly.
Can't wait to go back and try more on the menu.
A must try if you're in and around Central Birmingham.
We came across this gem by chance and boy was we happy .
The food was amazing the service perfect we couldn‚Äôt fault it .
We was celebrating my husbands birthday .
The staff certainly looked after us .
You really have a gem hidden away here.
Will look forward to coming again with my son.
By the way the corn on the cob was the best I‚Äôve ever had .
To die for .
Thank you so much each and everyone of you .
Highly recommended x
Cosy bar area on the ground floor.
Interesting selection of draft.
Service also  friendly.
The food doesn‚Äôt disappoint but it can take a while to get a seat.
When it‚Äôs busy, it can take a while for the food to arrive.
Though it‚Äôs worth the wait if you like your fried chicken cooked in different ways.
Highlight of the evening was their IPA (Steady Rolling Man).
I walked in today alone, welcomed by nice, helpful and friendly hosts.
I sat at the bar, and was offered a few samples before ordering after I told them that I normally drink pilsners  I had a pint of Bonehead Pilsner and a Double Bourbon and to eat, I was served some amazing Cauli Wings with vegan garlic mayo  The atmosphere was amazing.
Staff were so friendly and helpful  Will definitely return
Place is good price/performance one.
I suggest charcoal cooked shishs instead of pizza.
In addition nutella-banana made dessert is nice!
A definite all round crowd pleaser in terms of the food and service.
The Shish Taouk and Mixed Grill definitely wowed.
A ‚Äòmust visit‚Äô again.
Fantastic as always, thank you La Vera!
Really nice restaurant, excellent value.
I eat here often and tried multiple dishes, alway very tasty.
Would recommend and will defo return.
Beautiful place to eat pizza or BBQ meet.
The place is big and spacious has a terrace and upstairs seating.
I tried the chicken & Shish plater , it was just perfect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Lovely and well marinated chicken the chips were perfect , the most natural detox juice ginger and carrot ‚Ä¶ all was great ‚Ä¶.
The service was impeccable , the toilets  were average they did not have soap.
Absolutely amazing food!
Definitely recommend charcoal grilled half chicken.
FRESHLY juiced fruit drinks Complimentary Arabian Tea and bread AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, every staff member in this restaurant deserves a medal of honour GREAT FOOD!
Never have a bad meal here and that‚Äôs all that needs to be said!
The food is amazing, the spring rolls offer such a unique taste.
I have to recommend the chicken wings and ribs the meat is so succulent and the sauce is to die for.
My go to is a big bowl of egg fried rice and crispy belly pork.
The food is so fresh and the taste is all the better for it.
Friendly service and a lovely setting in Birmingham.
Had a great time at Vietnamese food kitchen next to the bullring.
Service was top notch and the food was full of flavour.
Recommend getting the lemongrass beef curry pho with big chunks of beef!
Delicious Will come back again!
I recently visited this street food restaurant for the second time, and the food both looks and tastes delicious.
Although we had to wait a bit for a table, I've noticed that the menu changes; this time, my favorite fish bao buns were not available.
Nevertheless, I tried other dishes that were fresh, beautifully presented, and served with good intervals between courses.
It's worth checking their website for promotions.
On the day I visited, they had a three-course festive menu, which I had to inquire about, but the staff promptly provided details.
The cocktails, appetizer, main course, and dessert offered in the festive menu were more than sufficient for someone with a hearty appetite, as the portions are genuinely generous.
I recommend this place on Birmingham's culinary map.
We were served by Nga Henry, who gave us excellence service, the food and drink came out very quickly and tasted delicious!
The portions were also huge and priced very reasonably.
We were constantly checked up on to make sure everything was okay - I would definitely recommend and I can‚Äôt wait to come back!
Big place, perfect for Big groups.
Upstairs and downstairs spaces with huge glass surfaces overlooking the square and the church.
outside space available.
Tasty, unique menu that will satisfy your craving for Asian cuisine.
Quick, Friendly and helpful service by staff.
Pork Belly crunchy and tasty.
Spare ribs superb.
Spring rolls exceptional.
Chicken wow.
Recommended
I just wanted to say that I visited your restaurant last year and had an amazing experience!
The food was delicious and the service was exceptional.
I can't believe I forgot to leave a comment earlier, but I wanted you to know how much I enjoyed my visit.
Keep up the great work!
What an amazing experience ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ A delicious family owned restaurant!
I crave their Eritrean food on many occasions, dipping Injira bread into a platter of a variety of tastes, from spicy to mild vegetables.
I have had different types of Eritrean food.
It is a great place for small parties up to 8 or 10 or even more than that #Or even for a romantic dinner.
10/10
Good food, nice people, best value for money I‚Äôll give it 100%
Eritrean traditional food in Birmingham
Very Good place and they‚Äôre very friendly üíØüëçüèæ
We were in a big group of 20 and they were able to accommodate us without issue, taking the downstairs area just for us which was really nice.
The staff were also excellent and were very fast with service.
Considering there were so many of us, it was great to see that they had prepared well.
The food was mostly good, with some of the portion sizes being larger than I could handle.
My picks were the cola wings, chicken mole burrito and the mango strawberry dessert.
The cola wings and the mango dessert were my favourites of the night.
The only slight downside to the experience was that there was a weird smell to the downstairs.
You do adjust to it after a short while, but definitely something to be improved on.
But overall a good experience.
Do no go to bodega.
There's plenty of places with food and cocktails that you can go to in Birmingham.
My experience was lacklustre and made me sick when I got home.
I ordered the burger, basically a patty in a wrap, with overly oily fries and a pot of mayo from a bottle.
Basically a weekday dinner made by a student.
There were dots of oil left on the soggy paper under where each fry was.
We were sat at wonky table in the corner.
I'd be accepting of the less than mediocre food quality and poor atmosphere if the food was cheap.
But the prices were high and what you expect for central Birmingham.
the food I could have made better with my eyes closed.
The pitiful portions of tacos didn't last me two bites.
What an enormous disappointment.
I'd rate it lower if I could.
You can see from the picture how dark it was in the corner.
This was 1.30pm.
Why is it so dark in here??
I couldn't even comment on the poor food to my fried as I was sat right next to the cash register.
I don't understand how you can call this a restaurant.
A fast food joint maybe.
I will not be returning!
What a shame to catch up with an old friend in such a grim place.
This total meal costs ¬£34.
For 2 places of food and a black coffee.
üëé
Lovely place, it was very packed which is great to see however we were seated right in-between the door and a large staff night out.
As people who were out on a date it was loud and alot especially when the shots came out for the large table, maybe these could be placed in their own section or near other large groups.
Food wise, absolutely beautiful chorizo burrito and sweet potato fries, however the size of it left me starving, there was no salt and pepper on the table, no offer of sauces, took a while to come, then we weren't offered any extra drinks, were all finished for about 30 minutes before we had to shout for the bill and then it took an extra 15 after that before we actually got it.
Me personally, lovely food but portions wise is the main reason I don't think I'd come back unfortunately.
Had to update this as I went back here again expecting the same experience .
Started off well got drinks and sharing nachos but after that it all went down hill we wait for over 20 mins for anyone to even ask us anything or even be available‚Ä¶in the end had to call the manager and he just apologized and we asked to for the bill after which they didn‚Äôt even offer to reduce anything would def not be coming back  Turned up late due to traffic staff were really accommodating even though we missed our booking ‚Ä¶waitress was great and attentive ..did have a little issue with the rice but they replaced without any issues ..food on the whole was amazing and lovely atmosphere would definitely visit again‚Ä¶.
Went in for lunch on a work day.
We were welcomed with a smile and got promptly seated and then were forgotten for about 15 mins, even though the waiters were just walking around.
And finally when our order was taken, we were informed that it would take time because there were many people( honestly, a lot of them were mostly drinking).
We said okay but little did we know that we had to wait for 45 mins to not have our food served and our work waiting at office.
When we finally asked the waiter to check on our food, he went in and brought our food in the next 2 mins.
Idk what that implies.
Outrageously slow!
And the food was not worth the wait.
Poor flavours, very ready-to-eat kinda flavours, not authentic mexican flavours.
The enchilada was a dry and the filling had no spices, just a load of butter.
The tacos were tiny but okayish.
The spicy rice had a stale smell to it.
The halloumi burger was a dry wrap of a halloumi in a tortilla bread( this was by far better tasting than the rest though).
I have given 2 stars for food only because my friend insists that it helped our hunger and we should be grateful.
Also, he has never had mexican food before.
While paying for the bill which came to 40 pounds, the paying machine asked us to select an amount for the tip and the waiter kept directly looking at us choosing one and it was so impolite and we felt compelled to pay a tip even though the service didn‚Äôt deserve it (you see we are mild people who are incapable of being rude or speaking up and asking for a confrontation).
The drinks were great though.
2 for 12¬£ and great flavours.
Oh and an old couple came in much much after us and were served within minutes, even though they ordered more or less the same items we had ordered.
The ambience is really good but a shame how things are run here and the quality of food.
I am not coming back or suggesting it to my friends.
Christmas Day 2023 was amazing, so happy that we chose Asha‚Äôs!
The atmosphere was buzzing, the demographic was so diverse and everyone seemed really happy.
Cocktails at the bar to start followed by delicious starter and main.
There was so much food we had to take half of it home.
First time but will definitely be back, what a treat!
Thank you so much for looking after us and for being so wonderful!
Great dishes, nice staff.
Perfect for a celebration.
The Lobster is legendary.
They really pride themselves on their cocktails, and they don‚Äôt disappoint.
I‚Äôve been going for 10 years and it never fails to deliver.
Amazing food!
Amazing staff!
Amazing atmosphere!
Overall an amazing experience!
The staff were all so friendly and welcoming and helpful when it came to the menu.
Our waiter in particular was extremely helpful and recommended some items on the menu.
The food was delicious and the service was quick.
Recommend the chicken biryani.
They also have a lot on their menu which gives it a homely kind of vibe.
Cocktails as well!
They have various selection of cocktails and they all sounded amazing.
Just so expensive haha.
I love the fact they have pictures on the walls of each celebrity that has visited, even the King!
And also each celebrity has their own favourite meal.
It‚Äôs a nice touch to the place.
A lot of awards as well, which is great!
You can also have your own room for a bigger party (think 10+) which is a nice idea for birthdays, etc.
Definitely going back to this restaurant as the food and staff were amazing.
Highly recommend date night here.
Expensive but worth it, value and quality was up there.
Great food if you like a rich flavor and decent portions, we had a late lunch after a game of VR.
The service was excellent, food arrived hot and tasted perfect.
As always the roomalli roti is one of my favorites.
I recently had the pleasure of dining at Asha Food Restaurant and I must say, it was an incredible experience!
The ambiance of the restaurant is absolutely fantastic.
I had the Malai Soya Chaap and the Cheese Mushroom, and both dishes were absolutely divine.
The Malai Soya Chaap was incredibly flavorful and had a perfect balance of spices.
The texture of the soya chaap was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth.
Highly recommended!
Small portions, food looks good, taste is always lottery - avoid.
I paid ¬£19 for a really small plate of gnocci, which in my opinion was really bad!
I normally LOVE all food but think I would have prefer pesto pasta to this.
Really disappointing.
This review is based on food - the service was good.
A hidden gem.
Nestled away in Aston University Business School is the conference centres hotel and bar.
The restaurant offers a selection of varying dishes - lunch comes in at a very reasonable price point for the quality of offering, and is the subject of this review.
The restaurant is largely self serve for lunch, with table service for drinks and coffee.
Starters are offered as a self select buffet - typically soup, salads and a few extras - ones I've enjoyed recently being pressed ham hock and mackerel pate.
Two or three mains are served - I've seen meat, fish and vegetarian options.
Food tends to be straightforward and satisfying.
A small selection of desserts and cheese round of an enjoyable experience.
I've brought a few people here recently and it has gone down well on each occasion.
Great hotel
We went for a date for a very nice meal.
The staff were lovely and friendly.
The food was very nice, except the steak sauce was very vinegary, which complimented the steak quite well, but stand alone very strong.
Eton mess was very nice, but couldn't finish it as the fruit taste was also very strong.
Great ambiance and had live music.
The food was amazing.
Can definitely spend some good time.
The live music was too loud and kind of affected the time spent.
Went to celebrate a birthday.
Food was amazing ü§© 2 4 1 cocktails were fab only thing letting the place down was service , so slow Mayb short staffed.
Only place we have ever been that we got our food before drinks??!!
But would go again
Besides the long wait for the steaks, everything was amazing!
The fillet and sirloin were both cooked to perfection  House salad was good, but I did not like the beef bites on the loaded fries even though the sauce was great
We came here for Sunday breakfast after a late night.
It was buffet style of excellent quality, and for the price, I cannot see how it could be beaten.
Impeccable service as well made this one of the best breakfasts had.
I now have to come back in the evening to try their steaks!
It‚Äôs nice.
I had the aioli chicken rice and some gluten free chicken nuggets.
The staff was normal and ambiance is quite chill.
You do you basis.
The food was alright, not the best I have ever tried but for the price, it‚Äôs fair enough.
The pink latte was nice, a bit too watery.
Overall It wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice food place but it‚Äôs not bad either.
Food is great ...but the grand central based Leon staff are ridiculously slow.
The new younger ones working there would rather faff around then actually go up to serve customers who are waiting and willing to eat quick and jump on their next train !
Food you can't go wrong with but staff not so great ..improvements needed
The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice.
The vegan breakfast muffin and hash browns are excellent!
My only minor criticism; I ordered sweet chilli sauce with the hash browns, which wasn‚Äôt in the bag.
Otherwise, all good!
Lovely food and staff member serving was very helpful.
Lovely, friendly and attentive staff.
Food is always well prepared.
Fantastic experience for my birthday.
My girlfriend was kind enough to take me here to celebrate and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.
The staff were fantastic and the food was outstanding.
A real feast for the eyes, nose and mouth.
If you like fine dining this is fabulous.
Came her for the long tasting menu and what an incredible experience it was.
15 courses of some of the best food I've ever eaten.
The texture and the flavours were mind blowing.
The desserts we had were better than all the Michelin star restaurants in Birmingham.
The experience was brilliant and the staff were great.
I will definitely be back for the food but the desserts were amazing.
Exceptional.
Food: Diverse menu, Imaginative, Creative, and a sensory adventure.
Ben Tesh & his team offer Birmingham serious Foodies a treat for all senses.
Drinks: The wine flight adds another dimension to the food, bringing out subtle flavours and experiencing the wines change with each mouthful.
Service: Staff were extremely attentive, friendly & knowledgeable about the menu, including where all the produce was from, including wines.
Atmosphere: Exactly what you would expect with a fine dining experience, Clean, Crisp, modern dining, a bright restaurant with Minimalist decor, clean bright toilets with nice soap & Moisturiser.
All the dinnerware, Cutlery & glass wear was tactile, modern & luxurious.
This enhanced our experience.
Value: Three of us spent ¬£400 it was worth every penny.
We would highly recommend, and we can‚Äôt wait to return.
This is a restaurant to visit if you appreciate good food and good wine We had the long tasting menu and associated wines (not sure how happy the credit card was) and it was very enjoyable.
The chef is obviously an expert on savoury flavours, the desserts divided is a little.
Excellent food, a great experience in Birmingham city centre.
I'll definitely recommend the 7 course dinner, as all of the dishes were amazing.
Wine pairing was also very pleasant.
We were going to see Editors at the 02 Academy, were booked into Holiday Inn at Snowhill / Constitution Hill & needed to grab some food.
My husband had found Syriana in an online search of nearby places.
Possibly some of the best service we‚Äôve had in a while (our server was lovely & knowledgable) and wonderful food.
Little extras like complimentary flatbread, hummus & pickles, then mint tea at the end.
The vermicelli rice was a revelation.
Visually beautiful food and totally delicious.
Food is very delicious, you should try it if you visit Birmingham, price is reasonable and they have various Arabic dishes.
The atmosphere is quite and nice.
Staff especially (Sarah) are very friendly and smiley.
The food was very authentic and delicious.
They also served us tea after we finished, and it was on the house.
Really recommend it üëçüèº.
Very nice restaurant.
Can't fault the food.
We enjoyed everything we had.
I has seabass, partner had lamb and sis in law had minced lamb.
The service we recieved was good, the waiter/ owner was very freindly and efficient.
Good value for money too.
This is the first time having a Syrian cuisine and it was a good experience.
We ordered the sheesh tawook and freekah.
Freekah was a very heavy dish careful when you order hoping it to look like a grill platter but it's not.
It's more of a rice chicken with grains and almonds.
Overall it was a good experience with a very welcoming and warm staffs and an amazing ambience.
Enjoy eating üòú
We really enjoyed having dinner at Syriana restaurant.
There was a C shape sofa, at the end of the restaurant, we really like it, that we had our privacy.
The food was supper good, except that a few starters were a little cold (dolma).
Sarah was a friendly person, who smiled and she was always there.
Hearty, healthy meal for a reasonable price.
The dish I have taken a photo of cost me ¬£9.
Caters for all (including  vegans and vegetarians) A sincere Ethiopian man greeted us with love.
Highly reccomend!
Not going to lie, wasn't quite sure what to expect, and when my food arrived (special spicy chicken) my first thought was to wonder how I could escape!
Don't let the presentation put you off- food was AMAZING!
Super fresh and tasty, and the unfermented bread was a pleasant addition.
Couldn't help think it could have been presented differently (!!)
But genuinely delicious.
And the Eritrean beer is worth a try too.
I'd definitely return.
Nice Eritrean food and the atmosphere is very African and loads of different races enjoying the meal.
Clean and good customer service was a nice experience.
This restaurant attracts many locals which is a good sign.
Locals as in ones from east Africa.
Personally the food was tasty and cooked to my liking.
Can get very busy so recomend to book a table in advance.
The price of food is reasonable.
Many dishes to choose from aswell.
Do recomend if you would like a change of food culture.
If not the  just to enjoy the taste of east africa.
Eritrean traditional coffee is the best I recomend you to try it after the meal.
Tek showed me a lecture of rich culture and amazing food from Eritrea, he‚Äôs my friend now  ‚úåÔ∏è will definitely come back a lot
Absolutely amazing.
Come here every week.
It is so delicious.
Thank you to the owner Tek for his brilliant customer service
Great food and lovely ambience .
We tried the tiki chat , samosa chat and chole bhature .
Chats  were really lovely and nice portions but Chole bhature could have been better .
It was our first time at this place and would definitely be visiting it again .
We came here on the recommendation of a friend and had a marvellous time.
Initially when we arrived, they had no tables.
They booked us in for an hour later, and when we came we were shown straight to our table.
The staff were friendly and attentive without being overbearing.
The menu was explained, and we were recommended a few dishes.
We ended up following his advice, and got the perfect amount.
Everything we ate was delicious.
We had the chef's special chicken dish and a spinach and lamb curry, as well as a few sides.
We both tried the tea, with the ginger one being our favourite.
Price-wise, this was excellent value for money.
We paid under ¬£20 per person and felt very satisfied.
All in all, would definitely go again
Visited this Indian restaurant for lunch while at work and it was good.
The restaurant is very close to work and had a lunch offer which was the pull for it.
The curry was pretty good and I went for the optional Chai as well which was top notch.
The portion size was smaller than expected for ¬£6.50 compared to prices in B'ham and the chai would have been better if it was bundled up with the food which would make it less costly.
But we shouldn't complain about paying ¬£2.50 for a good chai when a Starbucks costs ¬£5.
Will try a proper sit-down meal here later and review.
The food was good, however we had to wait nearly 35-40 minutes after the order.
We were served by Abhi, who kindly greeted and helped us through menu.
Such a great experience, I highly recommend going there.
The service was very welcoming and helpful in picking which meals/drinks to combine.
The food really felt home-made and was packed with flavours.
The decoration and overall atmosphere was good.
I recommend the first mocktail with vanilla, and for food take your pick, some dishes are similar to Mediterranean ones (aubergines and minced meat) and there's a great variety of bread.
Prices are also good
The best seafood pasta that I've ever had.
I had the Swordfish with a side of ink pasta and I was astounded.
I've eaten a lot of pasta dishes, and they had all tried to accomplish what this dish pulled off.
It was robust, strong, flavorful beyond expectation, and just breathtaking.
I could taste the sea when I chewed the Swordfish, the pasta was bold and thick, and the roasted tomatoes were phenomenal.
Everything complimented each other beautifully and combined for a complete dish.
The atmosphere was giving Anthony Bourdain and I feel lucky to have gotten a seat.
Our server was excellent, accommodating, and never rushed us.
The cooks were incredible, and the ability to watch them cook our meal was a treat.
It was our anniversary and I couldn't imagine a better place to be.
Must see
Phenomenal food!!
We wait for a bit in line (I did not know this is the original location and the waterfront location has less people/is bigger/takes reservations) but regardless,, it‚Äôs was worth it!!
Such great quality pasta and such fresh seafood.
My favorite was the vongole paService was superb and I was entranced by the chef cooking.
Would definitely recommend and would come back next time I‚Äôm in Boston!
As we drove up from NYC-Boston we started to research our food options when we came across the review to The Daily Catch.
Instantly we felt intrigued to try it!
We were not disappointed as the review were on point with the details of every dish.
We started with fresh toasted Italian herbs and garlic bread, clam casino crispy (5) breaded and seasoned to perfection, larger than your ordinary baked clams.
I had the shrimp, scallop and broccoli over pasta.
First bite was a extremely hot and I was not able to dive in, but as I continued to eat and the food was cool enough to really let the seasonings and herbs dance in my mouth.
I was pleasantly satisfied!
My husband had the Frutti di Mare: It was a mix sea food in red sauce over linguini.
At first glance it appeared to be a bit watery but it did not diminish the taste.
All dishes are served in a pan as this is their historic mark.
Their beer selection is limited but they do have wine, water & sodas.
Highly recommend The squid ink pasta puttanesca was a delightful symphony of bold flavors, with the brininess of olives and capers perfectly complementing the rich, savory squid ink sauce.
Paired with impeccably cooked fried calamari, the dish achieved a harmonious balance of textures.
Each bite was a culinary adventure, leaving me thoroughly satisfied.
This place had ‚ÄúAnthony Bourdain‚Äù written all over it.
Figuratively, not literaly.
I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ever been.
But this restaurant is a place that he would‚Äôve ADORED.
Very small, no more than 15/20 tables.
Big open and exposed kitchen, and some of the absolute best seafood you‚Äôll have in Boston.
So much so, that my partner and I came here for our 1 year anniversary dinner.
They got the North End style Swordfish with a side of black ink pasta.
I got the Linguini and Clams also with the black ink pasta.
This was the most excellent way to celebrate our special day.
We aren‚Äôt very fancy and neither was this restaurant, which added to the charm.
They don‚Äôt need fancy cocktails or chandeliers from the ceiling, as the food speaks for itself.
Our server was very sweet and working hard to make sure we, as well as everyone else in the restaurant was well taken care of.
Would love to come back on our next trip to Boston.
If you don‚Äôt stop here while in the North End, you‚Äôre truly doing yourself a disservice.
Thank you The Daily Catch !
Stopped for lunch after a brisk 90 minute jaunt through the aquarium.
Very kid friendly.
Breakfast and lunch served on the kids menu!
They were kind enough to stow our stroller out of the way as well.
Jewel of the crown was amazing.
Spicy chicken sandwich brings some heat.
Raw Oysters were prepared very well.
No horseradish, though.
Very cozy atmosphere.
We picked this location as it was closest to the aquarium but were very happy with the food.
I shared the children's pizza with my son and would try something else next time!
The Salad and steak tips were very much enjoyed
We popped in on New Years Day.
Our server Antonio was great.
My friend enjoyed both oysters, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the lobster roll (warm) was great but could have used a little more butter.
I ordered a short stack of pancakes, they were thin and little dry but tasty with the butter and syrup.
Only down side is it was rather chilly inside.
We were seated in the far back and it seemed a little crowded.
Great restaurant for group dinners, conveniently located in the seaport area.
There is a bar, as well as many tables.
Was crowded on a Thursday night, but the place was not so loud that you had to shout, which I liked.
Our server recommended the baked cod, burger, and pork chop.
I tried the baked cod, which was delicious.
The cod was cooked perfectly: very soft and seasoned well.
The bean pur√©e was smooth and mild but added a depth of flavor.
The state street platter was a good appetizer for sharing amongst 3-4 people.
I think the seafood could have been a tad fresher, but it was good overall.
I also tried the pot de cr√®me.
I was surprised (in a good way) by how large the dessert was for the price ($10).
The biscotti was very good, and the mousse was rich.
I liked that it was a cold dessert, but it was quite heavy for one person.
I recommend sharing it.
Everyone at the table finished their dish, so I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with anything.
Our server was also friendly, and we did not feel rushed.
My only complaint is that it was a bit too dark in the restaurant.
The sticky bun was absolutely amazing!
We talked about how good it was for days and want to go back just to get another one.
It‚Äôs definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people.
The butter biscuits, honey yogurt parfait, and spicy chicken sandwich were also very yummy!
I could give The Chart House a 5 star on the food alone all day long, but we had a particularly great experience today.
My daughter, unfortunately, has celiac disease and it has been a real challenge to find places to accommodate her while also having good food.
She loves clam chowder, but has mostly resigned herself to the fact that it's made with flour and only enjoyed as a memory.
I had called and spoke with Brian the restaurant manager to ask about gluten free options.
I told him about me daughter's plight and he surprisingly told me that the chef could make clam chowder gluten free.
When we went to the restaurant today for lunch,  they had prepared it just for my daughter.
It sounds silly, but I was almost tearful seeing the smile on face and watched her devour a bowl full of the best clam chowder ever.
I cannot say enough for this restaurant.
The food was superb,  but the reason to have a restaurant in the first place was evident in that smile on my daughter's face.
Thanks Chart House.
Can't wait to come back.
Fantastic Historic Restaurant right on the Harbour.
Really impressive building with so much history!
Service was impeccable, super friendly and welcoming staff.
The food was promptly served and it was absolutely delicious!
I went for fish tacos & Ceasar Salad with Salmon.
Both amazing, big portions but I was super hungry.
Amazing selection of wine as well, I went for Californian CabSav .
Strongly recommended, THANKS TO THE AMAZING STAFF WORKING THERE.
We had a really friendly waiter who gave as a bit of history on the place.
Learned it's the 3rd oldest building in Boston and John Hancock owned it/worked out of it.
The food was delicious and the chocolate lava cake is worth it!
It's 3 stories, but has seating available on the ground floor so mobility can be accommodated We want to go back already.
This place is a gem!
They have outdoor dining, indoor dining and a bar.
Multiple levels indoors.
Food was delicious!
üòã And very reasonably priced.
I couldn't finish my meal and desperately wanted to because it was so good.
My friend got the salmon and it was also delicious.
Neat historic decor on the inside, just a very nice atmosphere.
Will definitely be back!
Really enjoyed my time at Chart House!
Everything we tried was delicious and the service was so good!
Learning the history of the building, trying some fresh catches, and so much more - this is a place to go when in Boston!
Food is good.
Not spectacular, but pretty good for the price.
They have the older style of dumplings with the thick skin that I prefer not the gyoza ones.
The beef noodle soup is a good portion size and decent flavors.
Overall, a good spot to try.
You don't come for the atmosphere.
You come for the fresh authentic soup dumplings.
The beef and green beans were terrific, as were the dumplings, white rice, and soup.
We cone every year after seeing the Nutcracker.
Such a great hidden gem.
Amazing authentic Chinese food.
Dumplings were out of this world.
Scallion pancakes were the best we‚Äôve had.
Loved every bite!
Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
Good food!
The rice was a little plain but otherwise delicious.
Servers were quick to get us out of there though.
Late night visit with my partner.
Service was not super welcoming but quick.
Frankly authentic places aren‚Äôt always welcoming so I took that as a green flag.
If you know you know.
We ordered the orange chicken, seafood fried rice, vegetables dumplings, and scallion pancakes(not pictured).
Honestly was a lot more food than we anticipated so we were excited to have leftovers.
All the food was amazing.
Next time I will try the seafood or shrimp dumplings as the vegetable was a little dry.
Overall, great late night spot!
First time to PF Changs, I enjoyed it more than I anticipated for a chain restaurant.
The food and old fashions were delicious.
Customer service was horrible.
You could tell the staff was over whelmed, it was around 3pm so it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpeak time‚Äù.
We received our drinks and food with no water, after specifically asking for water when she first took our drink orders.
It took a while for her to return so we could even get water.
The manager came to drop off our second order of dumplings and she was way more pleasant.
Over all, I would return but if the customer service was better it would have been way more enjoyable.
Food was fine.
PF changs it‚Äôs like a hybrid between mall food and restaurant experience.
However, the service was poor.
Our waiter was visibly overwhelmed.
He didn‚Äôt come to our table until 10-15mins after the e got seated.
Our table was visibly dirty with food and no cutlery.
We ordered food and and when we received it we still didn‚Äôt have cutlery.
Overall, poor service at this location.
OK food.
This PF Changs location is ALWAYS our go-to spot when attending shows in Boston's theater district.
We park in the garage that's attached to the same building (City Place on Charles St), dine at PF Changs, then head to our events (2 blocks away).
The food here is consistent, and always very good!
This visit was on Thursday at 5pm- no line with many available tables (basically not busy).
Thank you for your great service, and great food!
üëçüòé
We had delicious food, tasty teas, the absolute best server EVER!
Her name was Becca, and if you get lucky enough to have her wait on you, your day and night will be complete.
She was an absolute joy.
We would come back just to have her be our server.
Kudos for hiring such a gem.
10 out of 10 HIGHLY recommend!
The food is so flavorful and delicious!
The service is excellent and the ambiance is relaxed and upscale.
I love PF Changs in general but this location is really nice!
Wow!
My friend and I did not expect this spot to be as good as it is.
We were greeted kindly, seated quickly and served well.
The food was delicious, I had panang curry tofu, I forgot to say I wanted mine Thai spicy but I was pleasantly surprised by their spices in flavor profile.
My friend had phad khee mao and it looked delicious to me, that's normally what I go for.
The texture of the noodles was perfect that day.
Might have to come back!
It's so hard to capture how fresh the veg is and how right this dish- The Mermaid (?)
is.
Bright herbs, fresh spice.
The fish is cooked perfectly.
Branch out from Phad Thai here - I asked my server what to order and she was spot on.
Food was just ok.
I had much better Thai food everywhere else.
I ordered beef drunken noodles but I could only eat the noodles the meat was gross.
And my beef salad wasn‚Äôt bad
Everything we tried with my family was extremely delicious.
We had pad Thai and also crispy pad thai.
Red curry was also incredible and it was our favorite.
Service was slow.
They bring water almost at the end of the dinner.
Overall it was a really good experience.
I give four stars because there was a thin aluminum foil in my food.
It happens and it's not a big deal I will definitely go there again.
Our servers were very friendly.
However, food was overall mediocre.
We ordered the Drunken Noodle, a spicy beef salad, and the Montien Hotpot.
The spicy beef salad was not bad.
Good portion of grilled beef.
But there were not enough salad leaves in it.
The drunken noodle was disappointingly bland.
It was salty enough, just not flavorful.
The bamboo shoot in it has a strong metallic taste from the can.
If you eat a lot of Thai food, you know what I‚Äôm talking about.
The montien hot pot was okay.
Would not order again.
Went in two times: late dinner and breakfast.
Great experience both times.
Our server during dinner was great!
Took great care of us.
It was a busy loud Saturday night.
Calamari was delicious whereas the  chicken sandwich was a bit dry.
During breakfast, the restaurant was quiet and calm.
I had chocolate chip pancakes with a side of home fries and eggs.
Super tasty!
Overall, I had a great experience with very tasty food.
Would go back next time I am visiting Boston!
This was a pleasant surprise on our recent trip to Boston.
We stayed at The Bostonian and ate here one evening when we didn‚Äôt have reservations anywhere else.
I was expecting mediocre hotel food but what we had was so good we went back for lunch the following day.
We shared small plates and loved the zucchini chips with tzatziki so much.
I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about them.
We also loved the chicken skewers.
Tender and flavorful.
And the shrimp in tomato sauce with peppers and onions was top notch.
I could pass on the Greek lemon potatoes and Greek fries with feta.
They were fine but nothing special.
The servers were friendly, prompt, and accommodating.
I would go out of my way to eat at this place again next time I‚Äôm in Boston.
Staying at the Bostonian Boston and decided to come down for a bite and a drink.
Had a fun time chatting it up with the bartender, Chris, who was excellent at making unique and balanced cockails.
Also - $1 oysters??
OBVIOUSLY.
I would have liked to have some malt vinegar with them but they were delicious, nonetheless!
We're staying at the Bostonian Boston this weekend and decided to grab breakfast here - we ordered the eggs benedict with spinach and tomato as well as the caprese avocado toast.
Both were delicious and very fresh!
We were staying at the Bostonian so we figured we would try out North 26 for dinner.
There weren't many people in there and now I know why.
The servers were pleasant but the food was mediocre at best yet they were charging fine dining prices.
Gratuity and a $5 "for the hell of it" charge was also automatically added.
Our bill ended up close to $200 for what was maybe a $100 meal.
We definitely won't be going back, it's just not worth it.
Had a good meal.
Walked in Friday night and waited not too long for a table.
Front desk young lady very nice and accommodating, as well as the wait staff.
Food was good.
Had shrimp melek sela and the roti appetizer.
Entree was a tad greasy but otherwise a good meal.
I will come back to try other dishes as they are tasty and authentic.
Tons of things to try.
Give it a go!
I recently had the pleasure of dining at Penang Malaysian Restaurant in Boston for lunch, and I wanted to share my experience with you.
Overall, it was a delightful visit, thanks to the warm and inviting ambiance of the restaurant and the friendly staff.
Upon entering, I was immediately drawn to the cozy and welcoming atmosphere inside the restaurant.
The tasteful decor and comfortable seating created a pleasant dining environment, perfect for enjoying a relaxed meal.
The staff at Penang Malaysian Restaurant deserves special recognition for their exceptional hospitality.
From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a genuine sense of friendliness.
Their attentiveness and willingness to assist us throughout our dining experience made us feel truly valued as customers.
As for the food, I ordered a variety of dishes, including nasi lemak, roti canai, chow kueh teow noodle, kangkung balacan, and chicken satay.
The nasi lemak and the noodle dish stood out to me as particularly delicious.
The flavors were authentic and satisfying, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chef.
However, I found the other dishes to be just average in taste.
For additional information, this restaurant does not have kid menu.
Despite this, the exceptional staff friendliness and the  inviting ambiance of the restaurant more than made up for any minor shortcomings in the food.
The overall experience was enjoyable, and I would certainly consider visiting Penang Malaysian Restaurant again in the future.
I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for their warm hospitality and commend the restaurant for creating a welcoming atmosphere.
Thank you for providing a pleasant dining experience.
Dishes are yummy, nothing to complain.
My son likes the fish soup noodles the most and I like the Hannah chicken.
The Thai tea is sweet but favor is great.
I used to come here twenty years ago while I was in college.
This restuarant does not disappoint!
Still amazing!
Thank you for never changing your incredible recipes.
The roti cani is our favorite (no pictures because it was inhaled by our kid's).
Roti cani is a must order!!
The prawn mee is delicious.
I used to get it on cold Boston days.
The kids liked the beef Choi fun!
Loved the food that I ordered here!
I loved the pancake?
that you use to dip with curry.
The stir fried dishes were really yummy (really recommend the beef) so I will definitely come back here!
!
Omg.
Yum!
The 1/2 cheese 1/2 pepperoni pizza.
The onion rings.
The garlic cheese bread & the Caesar salad.
The portions are definitely for sharing.
I‚Äôm a little person but I love to try new spots.
We just saw the Blue Man Group, hit this spot up.
Just a few blocks away!
I paid Boston Kitchen Pizza a visit and man I was not disappointed.
I went for the honey chicken slice for $5 which was huge.
I wasn‚Äôt feeling well or would have had more, but it was hot, tasty and filling.
Highly recommended!
!
Hands down best pizza I ever had.
I had a buffalo chicken slice (good) and a honey glazed chicken slice (even better).
Thin crust, perfectly and evenly crispy on the bottom, generous amount of chicken throughout the slice, and a flavorful cheese.
You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
This has been one of my favorite take out places in downtown for years.
I was stressed out about packing to leave the country for a month, just wanted a familiar, filling and good dinner and even though Im all the way in Somerville now, and these guys didn't disappoint.
The food prep & delivery from Uber was super fast and their buffalo chicken wrap as always was grilled to perfection.
Their menu is huge and even though I always go back to their wraps, everything else I've ordered has always been incredible too.
If you need an affordable meal made with care and fresh ingredients, this is your spot friends.
Love this place.
Best slice in the area imo.
I‚Äôve been coming here for 10+ years and it‚Äôs the perfect spot to get one or two huge slices for under $10 on your trip.
Clean and safe place too, have never felt unsafe inside here.
I have a cousin from Maine that deliberately makes a stop here every time she comes to Boston, so take that as you will üòÇ
My list of gotos is expanding!
Found the perfect spot..(in-between subway spots..lol) and within walking distance to my current location.
Anytime I can get an abundant Lamb and Chicken combo, it's a win-win.
I've come here twice consecutively and have been blown away by the customer service, attention to detail, and their tasty offerings of chicken and lamb with cukes and tomatoes, which is my favorite.
Add the mint/cilantro/jalape√±o, some hot sauce, and the white sauce, and I'm extremely content.
Don't forget the lemonade.
I urge everyone to indulge no less than twice a week for the good food, ambiance, and excellent customer service.
Generous portion, tasty food, and ready in 3 min.
$15 for the plate with hummus.
Very good experience.
Only downside was they would not provide me a cup of water.
Everyone knows restaurants must give cup of water for free.
They told me they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have running water‚Äù, so best they could do was $3.50 for water bottle.
Not a big deal, but a little sleazy.
Delicious food.
Tried the Chicken Gyro Combo with Rice.
That was pretty good with white sauce.
Food was ready in 3-4 minutes.
Chicken and rice guys is the best!
Reasonable pricing and good portions of good.
Their garlic sauce is absolutely to die for!!!
Took it to go and eat in the Boston Commons one day - perfection!
So much better than chain fast food places.
They have gluten free options like the delicious halal chicken, hummus and all the sauces are gluten free!
The appetizers in this place gives you the feeling that you are going to be in for a great meal.
Unfortunately, everything goes downhill after the apps.
We ordered the lobster ravioli, it came with a very off-putting white sauce that looked like milk of magnesium.
The veal marsala was so salty it was barely edible.
On a positive note the appetizers were really good..I really don't get the hype behind this place though
I came here for dinner and really enjoyed my meal.
While I‚Äôm not an Italian expert, the atmosphere had more of a pub vibe than a trattoria, but the food did not disappoint.
We started with calamari which was perfectly crispy and came with a marinara sauce that we wanted to lick clean out of the ramekin.
It was so good.
For entrees, I got Maccheroni Chitarra and asked that they add garlic and a little spice.
Literally in the top 3 best pastas I‚Äôve had Boston.
So delicious and the portion was great.
My friends got the Cinque Terre and liked it, but they said my dish was their favorite.
üòã  Christian was a kind server, very accommodating and offered great entree recommendations!
The restaurant hits that nostalgic homestyle Italian restaurant.
Portions are good, prices are fair, and flavors are simple but well grounded.
Excellent place to eat very authentic Italian food in Boston!
Staff was very friendly and the food is delicious!
We were surprised on how inexpensive it was for the quality of the food!
Especially as a tourist in Boston!
Would definitely recommend!
Went on a Saturday when it was absolutely bucketing down rain, but it was definitely worth the wet feet.
The bread is amazing.
The Guazzeto di Mare is what to get when you want /all/ the seafood.
Calamari, shrimp, and fillet of sole in a light red sauce sit atop perfectly done and flavorful lobster ravioli.
(For about the same price as a basic lobster roll at today's - summer 2023- prices, and /so/ much more worth it!)
Be sure to save a last piece of bread to get all of the sauce.
Perfect New York style cheesecake, unadulterated by sauce, and cappuccino to finish.
I tried to wait our the rain with a second, and never felt rushed or that they were waiting on me to make room for the next group.
December 2023:  Food quality was much better than the first time I dined here.
Uni and salmon roe were both very good.
October 2023:  Quaint sushi restaurant close to the Boston Athenaeum.
The service was very good, quite attentive.
The food was okay.
The taste wasn't there for me.
There was a couple of ladies who were arguing at a table nearby.
Very traditional and authentic Japanese cuisine served in a classic traditional setting.
Most importantly the raw fish was extremely fresh and authentically sourced and prepared.
They‚Äôd a raw octopus appetizer which was delicate and delicious, the sweet shrimp was super sweet, and the baby yellowtail was like butter.
The uni from Maine was more like sweet Japanese uni and better tasting than San Diego uni.
The hamachi kama was a treat and huge.
This is as good as best sushi in Tokyo and very fresh and authentic, yet unbeatable prices especially for Boston.
Good quality sushi and creative rolls.
I was in Boston for work and I came here two nights in a row I liked it so much.
I like that the surroundings aren‚Äôt especially fancy, it‚Äôs just good food!
They have a lot of awards hanging on the wall.
Cozy Japanese eatery near Boston Commons.
Great menu and atmosphere.
I came here for a quick bite during lunch time and was pleasantly surprised by the food and service.
I would recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner with friends :)
To begin, I would like to point out that there is only one person on the whole floor.
This means, this person is the hostess, food runner and server.
While the restaurant might be small, this poor worker was running left, right and center.
To add on she was a tad passive aggressive but I can‚Äôt even blame her cause she was running the whole restaurant by herself.
When I walked in it took forever to get greeted and sat.
It took forever for her to take my order and thankfully it didn‚Äôt take so long for the food to come out.
On to the food, it was sooooo mid that I think I can classify it as bad.
The fish was not fresh, and the soup and salad was not fresh or good either.
The gyoza was both undercooked and burnt at the same time, but not in an ‚ÄúAl dent√©‚Äù type of way.
One great thing however is the atmosphere, it‚Äôs quiet, well lit and cosy.
However one does not go to a restaurant simply to enjoy the atmosphere, the food and service are more crucial.
If the food was as good as the atmosphere, then I would partially recommend this place, however you cannot eat vibes.
Please save yourself the trip and the money and do not eat here.
We stopped to read the menu and were very enthusiastically invited in by 2 regulars sitting near the door.
They couldn't recommend the place highly enough.
We ordered what they were having - the veal saltimbocca - and it was truly delicious.
Venturing into Rabia's Dolce Fumo, Friday night proved to be an extraordinary seafood expedition.
As a Texan eager for a taste of the Atlantic, the ambiance hit all the right notes.
Welcomed by a gracious woman in a black dress, the restaurant exuded a magnetic charm.
The cartoon-like aroma trail led us to a vibrant section with a concealed bar that added an element of surprise.
Our server, the remarkable Yaya, elevated the experience.
Patient and knowledgeable, she navigated us through the menu, turning the dining experience into a culinary journey.
The seasonal swordfish was a revelation‚Äîa delicate dish featuring a perfectly grilled filet accompanied by fresh vegetables and a light dressing.
Exploring further, the oysters were a highlight‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and needing no enhancement, except perhaps a squeeze of lemon.
The drink selection, despite being seasonal, possessed a timeless quality, as if crafted by seasoned mixologists.
Yaya's attentive service added an extra layer of enjoyment.
Her guidance enhanced our choices, making each plate a symphony of flavors.
Rabia's Dolce Fumo is not just a seafood haven; it's a masterclass in ambiance, service, and culinary excellence.
An unforgettable experience, and a heartfelt thanks to Yaya for making it truly exceptional.
Not bad but there are much better places in North End.
This is an easy spot to get a reservation but that says about what you need to know about the experience.
Overpriced for the quality of food and for that cost, you might as well go to a better spot in Boston‚Äôs Italian town
As a treat to myself, I found this hidden gem on Google.
A photo of the giant meatball appetizer drew me in (of course, I had that).
Let me tell ya!!
This is legit üëå The service was hands down the best I've had in idk how long!
They sat with me, laughed with me, genuinely made me feel welcomed.
And the food!!!
I had a bite of shrimp from my entree (Gamberi Dorati)... you know it's delish when someone just closes their eyes and savors it.
That was my reaction.
The quality and flavors were impeccable.
I am so glad I chose this spot for dinner.
I will have to go again before I leave Boston.
Thanks, guys!!
This Southern Belle could easily mix in with the Boston crowd.
Appetizer: North End giant meatball 10/10 Entree: Gamberi Dorati 10/10 Wine: Little Sheep sauvignon blanc 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Staff: off the charts!
Our favorite restaurant in Boston!
As always, a warm welcome by friendly staff followed by great cocktails.
Excellent food included gnocchi, salmon & delicious, authentic marinara & meatballs.
Staff was accommodating & did not rush us at all!
I even was given a Tshirt in celebration.
A must do when in Boston.
I didnt know Mediterranean food can be this good.
Place has limited seating.
No parking space available.
No high chair.
Most people do takeout here.
Crew were nice but clearly they are in a hurry to catch up with the orders.
Accepts credit/debit
Falafel King in Boston exceeds expectations with its unparalleled falafel that stands out as the best I‚Äôve ever tasted.
The service is not only prompt but also delivered with a touch of excellence, enhancing the overall dining experience.
The combination of flavors in the falafel, paired with the efficiency of service, makes Falafel King a must-visit for any falafel enthusiast in the Boston area.
The BEST place to get food in the area.
I lived in Boston this past summer and got food from here at least 3x a week.
Food is DELICIOUS and the workers are AMAZING and SO friendly.
So sad to leave this place but will come back anytime I get!!
!
Food is as a whole great.
But  1.
What is wrong with Pita bread?
It is so thin that it tastes like Armenian Lavash.
I didn‚Äôt under why the pita bread is not fluffy here?
I‚Äôm from Jerusalem.
I almost cried üòÖ  2.
Service is great!
Food tastes good.
Hummus tastes very authentic but Falafel is over fried.
3.
They used a bleach to clean it was very strong.
It smells strong.
But good food Will visit again
Great food for a great price!
Their hummus and falafels taste amazing together
I went here with my friend for hotpot.
What I really love about this place is the broth for hotpot.
My friend put me on the tomato broth and it is hands down one of the most delicious I‚Äôve ever tried!
Even after I finish with the meats and veggies, I‚Äôll still be scooping some of the broth into my bowl to sip on as soup.
They have a solid selection of meats and veggies that are pretty good relative to the price.
You can control the heat for the hotpot which is great because usually towards the end of dinner, you‚Äôll want to turn it down.
The ambiance is nice.
Definitely has a more modern and sleek interior.
When you walk in, you‚Äôll definitely get a feel as if this is a fusion restaurant.
One plus is that the heat source in the middle of table doesn‚Äôt take away any legroom which can happen depending on the hot pot place.
The servers were pleasant and professional.
I never felt like I waited too long and they always made sure to check in on us.
Overall, I would recommend if you‚Äôre looking to scratch your hotpot itch!
We never tried hot pot.. my partner and I had an amazing meal.
Our waiter was so great.. thank you for being so patient and helping us order.. the food was outstanding and Q made our whole evening.
Ty
Incredible experience.
It was our first time dining anywhere with hot pot and our waiter patiently talked us through the whole process and specifically highlighted favorites and popular options.
He even suggested a quantity for meats and vegetables.
At the end of our meal, he gave us Lunar New Year cards in lovely, red envelopes.
I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll try it again sometime soon!
Regular menu options are available, but I highly recommend hot cooking!
Dipping into a hot pot adventure at Chinatown's finest!
üç≤üî• Don't miss out on the sizzling experience and collect some warmth with collective cards hidden in lucky red envelopes.
üßß.
I'll be back again for delicious hot pot.
We got there around 10:00 pm.
It was busy and we had to wait.
Make sure you have reservation.
The food was good and it was more about the experience.
We ordered mushrooms broth and Japanese broth For food we ordered dumplings, veggie platter, beef tongue, fatty sirloin.
So some of our friends were vegetarian The downside was we were not able to have more than 2 broth.
So we had to keep one veggie broth kosher.
Not dumping any meat in it.
I go to Clover many times because it‚Äôs a healthy food chain and is located in a lot of convenient locations.
However, I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH about their recently introduced ‚ÄòVerde Rice and Bean Bowl‚Äô.
It‚Äôs so good, I have been having it everytime I go there, it is very filling, has a good combination of textures and colors, which makes it an even better experience.
I highly recommend this place for grabbing lunch/ dinner.
I also got to know that the CEO of Clover is Ayr Muir, who‚Äôs a distant cousin of the environmentalist John Muir
Stopped by to grab a bit; while visiting Boston.
Not entirely certain what was in the Popover I choose to eat.
Nonetheless, I do remember it being delicious.
The restaurant itself had a cool rustic feel with a nice big wooden table and chairs in the sitting area.
The entire facility was very clean; including the bathrooms.
The staff was very active and friendly; as I was immediately greeted upon entering.
Very helpful with choosing something that was vegetarian friendly.
Only wish they had a more options for us vegetarian/vegans.
Clover Food Lab always delivers great vegetarian foods.
I got the Egg and Eggplant sandwich with Apple Soda.
Sandwich was delicious and flavorful, and the egg provided complete protein.
The bread was soft with a slightly hard crust, and held up very well overall.
Apple Soda was good and unique.
I do wish for a bit of tartness from the apple.
Ordered the popover breakfast sandwich, which was some really interesting and delicious bread (which I later learned to be called the "popover") sandwiching a variety of ingredients and some white sauce which kind of tasted like ranch.
Overall, a really good combination.
I ended up staying at this Clover for several hours getting work done with their WiFi.
They only have a few power outlets.
It gets crowded during lunch rush but otherwise there's usually no line.
Healthy fast food at affordable prices!
Had the chickpea fritters and the egg&aubergine platters plus 2 sides, got us full in a deliciously healthy way.
We opted for this authentic Italian restaurant for a great breakfast over our standard cookie cutter overpriced hotel breakfast!
It was a delight and close to North End Freedom Trail stops.
The place was packed which meant it was a great pick!
Food was tasty.
Theo‚Äôs homemade hot sauce was HOT but our friend ended up buying a jar to take away.
Would recommend for a great experience and good food with plenty of portions!
I had really high expectations for this place, but unfortunately it fell short for me.
I enjoyed the coffee and the eggs, but that was about it.
I ordered the French toast as well and was SO excited for it.
To the eye, it looks realllllyyy good.
To the taste buds...not so much.
I was very disappointed.
No flavor at all in the toast itself.
I had to drown it in syrup in order to taste anything.
It's like the batter the bread was dipped in had nothing to it at all.
After seeing the reviews for this place, I was really excited to try it, but after my experience, I'm very hesitant to go back.
This place is definitely one of Boston's favorite.
Definitely kind of like a mom and pop hole in the wall but the food is great, however the place is really small and you're basically elbow to Elbow with your neighbor so if you don't like confine places don't bother coming.
But luckily I'm not an introvert so I meant a lot of people that were sitting next to me and some were from the same state that I was from so we just talked the whole time while waiting on our food.
There are two servers and the service were good and nice.
It's a cash Place only so don't bring your card here.
They give you plenty of food and again like I said the food is pretty good.
But you have to wait outside in line so there's No Reservations there's no wait list you wait in line until your turn so hopefully you won't go when it's cold
Stopped here for breakfast early on a Sunday with our family.
We were seated right away and had some great food.
The home fries were fresh and eggs cooked perfectly.
Try their homemade hot sauce - so so good.
The pancakes looked delicious so will have to try those next time!
Definitely a hidden gem!
We came late for lunch so the place was not busy.
Theo and team were there and they are friendly and welcoming us.
We order basic cheese burger, Theo‚Äôs special burger and Theo special brazilian rice dish.
All dishes were so delicious!!
They look basic but very flavourful.
We are happy with our order, the service and we‚Äôre priced reasonably.
The rice dish though was a lot so you can share if you are a light eater.
This was by far the best place we ate at during our week stay in boston!
Parking isn't too bad, there's a garage a block away and you can sit by the windows and look down at the water.
After you eat there's a walk way to go walk and see the old ship and walk along the water.
10 out of 10 recommend!
RATS in the restaurant!!
After frequently noticing bustling crowds outside this restaurant, particularly during summer, my curiosity was piqued.
The allure of what seemed to be a popular dining spot led us to finally visit one evening.
Contrary to our expectations, the restaurant wasn't crowded, allowing us to be seated immediately.
The ambiance was inviting, marked by fun decorations, and the service was quick and friendly.
However, the core of any restaurant experience, the food, fell short of expectations.
Anticipating authentic, high-quality cuisine, I was particularly let down.
My choice of the specialty crab BLT was marred by a substandard bun, diminishing the overall taste.
Accompanying fries and vegetables also failed to impress, lacking freshness and quality.
My husband opted for fish tacos, which he found enjoyable, but our experience took an alarming turn towards the end.
The sight of two large RATS scurrying through the restaurant was deeply unsettling.
This not only marred our dining experience but also raised serious concerns about hygiene and food safety!
The thought of these rodents possibly contaminating the food was nauseating.
In conclusion, while the restaurant presents a charming facade and offers friendly service, the lackluster food quality and alarming hygiene issues overshadow these positives.
If you're keen on avoiding potential health hazards and ensuring a pleasant dining experience, I would advise looking elsewhere.
We ate lunch here and enjoyed our visit.
Food was a little pricy, a small cup of clam chowder was $10, but everything we ordered tasted good.
I give this place a four star ranking because of the bad service, our waiter took our order and then we didn't see him again until he gave us a our check.
We tried to get his attention several times to refill our drinks but because of the location of our table he never saw us.
Great lobster Mac n cheese and crab roll.
I gave it only 4 stars because although the coconut margarita was quite good, it was a whopping $18 served in a clear plastic cup that was about 5 gulps and it was gone!
For that price I expected a bit more.
But, I would definitely go back.
The views are nice and atmosphere is fun.
My first time here.
Came on a weekend but the wait wasn't too long.
As others mentioned, this restaurant doesn't take reservations so be there early to avoid a  long line.
We ordered a steam lobster 1.5lb, lobster roll and fried calamari.
The food was good, price on the other hand is not too cheap for the food quality and casual dining atmosphere.
Service was good, servers all smiles and accommodating.
Overall, it‚Äôs a good dining place for casual dining with family and kids will like the colourful layout.
Not too ideal for couples or people looking for a chic ambience.
I was looking for a delicious place to sate our hunger after a very long day of walking.
It was absolutely delicious!
Definitely recommend going for their family special which will include a large soup, and 3 entrees for about $45
AMAZING!!!
Best place in Chinatown !
!!
Get the spicy salted fried pork chop!
I got this recommendation from a Lyft driver from Hong Kong (Kenny, was his name?)
he said he was friends with the owner of this place?
Anyways, a group of us were working at the convention center in town, and we decided to walk here‚Ä¶.
All five of us were completely dumbfounded at how amazing this food was!
I don‚Äôt think any of us knew that there was Chinese food that tasted like this.
Lol!
Thanks so much for the amazing service, and the great food !
If I‚Äôm in Boston again, I will come here!
An authentic Chinese‚Äîspecifically Cantonese‚Äîrestaurant that could be hard for non-Chinese to navigate/adapt to.
Tip for non-Chinese adventurers: just order their Coconut Chicken pot.
It‚Äôs a $49 non-spicy hot pot full of aromatic coconut water-based chicken broth that‚Äôs good for 2-3 people.
(Of course you probably need to add a few other vegetables/tofu topping for dietary fibers and carbs).
But if you ever seek a comforting broth to sip on on a windy cold day, this restaurant is one of the few places in downtown Boston that serves this dish other than your Chinese friends‚Äô own home.
$49 is not exactly so cheap for a pot dish, but if you were to try replicate this dish, you‚Äôd realize how much it costs just for the ingredients‚Äîa full pot of real coconut water (easily $20), fresh coconut meat (a $5 coconut & the hassle of opening it), a fresh half chicken, and some spices (goji berries, jojobas, etc.).
Plus the Chinese ladies who work there are passionate and warm-hearted to tell you how she‚Äôd eat the dish and guide you along the way‚Äîquite a bit of sharing while you eat which I find endearing but certainly can be annoying for some people.
This restaurant also has alive fishes that they cook to order and to your preference (typically minced garlic, preserved soy beans, or salted fried).
However, words has it that their line can get long for dinner, so if possible, lunch will be a better time to visit them.
Also, their environment is not entirely up to the standard of their pricing range, so one star deducted for warning purposes.
All in all, the Asian Garden is a decent Chinese restaurant authentic to the bone and only recommended to natives or open-minded explorers up for an non-Americanized dining experience.
Cheap and convenient!
I came here thanks to a local nift deal I had with a friend and was seated immediately.
There weren‚Äôt too many people inside.
Food: We got the beef chow fun and also the Mac and cheese with milk tea and also the tofu.
I thought that the food was quite standard Chinese food and nothing too special.
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the Mac and cheese special though.
Service: The waiters were extremely kind and helpful!
I was surprised, maybe because we were one of the few customers there.
Food also came super quickly!
Ambiance: Very causal.
It‚Äôs a little bit dirty inside.
Overall might not come again unless I had another nift deal!
A bit on the pricey side.
Their chicken and green beans are good, but it was kind of cramped in the restaurant, and they used disposable plates and cups.
They were able to accommodate a walk-in party of 6 on a Friday night fairly fast though, so props to them.
The food was delicious and a perfect blend of authentic Italian food and Boston‚Äôs seafood!
My friends and I came here for my partner‚Äôs birthday and we don‚Äôt regret it one bit!
I got the lobster ravioli and it was exquisite!
However, here are some things to note: - No reservations!
We were a group of 5, came within the opening hour, and waited about 15-20 minutes to be sat.
If your party is bigger or you come later, expect longer waits.
- CASH ONLY!
They do have an ATM inside but come prepare to avoid the ATM fees.
- You will be rushed!
It‚Äôs a tiny 2-story place that attracts a lot of people.
They want to sit as many people so you will feel rushed to order, eat, and leave (which really sucks since you‚Äôd want to savor such good and expensive food)
Recommended by our hotel and it did not disappoint!
We ate upstairs in their open air dining area which was a cool experience.
The chicken piccata was the BEST!
I ate the entire plate-couldn‚Äôt put my fork down!
The capers and lemon sauce were perfect and the bread and oil were true Italian.
Would revisit for sure!
!
This place was our savior on Friday night.
We had a reservation for the restaurant across the street and showed up early, but there were people who had reservations for an hour before, and were still waiting to be sat.
We were starving and waiting was not an option, especially since it was already past 9 PM.
We walked in, were sat right away, and were served everything we ordered almost immediately.
The food was incredible as well.
It‚Äôs a small, no-frills place, but the staff were lovely and straight to the point.
We had an excellent time here, and I would highly recommend instead of waiting for another spot
After eating here I realized I've never eaten good calamari in my life.
Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and came out quickly.
I was stuffed and simply could not stop eating because it was so good.
Fair warning this place is cash only so be ready because they kinda rush you out once you finish eating
What I loved about eating at Giacomo's was the authentic Italian feel, I felt like I was eating at home.
We ordered the Zuppa Di Pesce with the included bottle of wine option.
It came with lobster, shrimp, huge scallops, calamari, clams and mussels all served over the linguine and a saporito (tasty) sauce.
The sauce we chose was Fracomo, a combination of two sauces: the Giacomo and the Fra Diavolo.
The combination of a spicy Lobster based red sauce mixed with a Lobster based red sauce that has a touch of B√©chamel cream.
This dish was easily our favorite.
We also ordered two additional dishes.
There was plenty for the 5 of us.
The two additional dishes were clams and linguine with a Scampi sauce.
The white wine, garlic and oil hit all the notes of a perfect dish.
And lastly we ordered the shrimp and linguini in the Giacomo sauce.
Located in the North End.
Boston's Italian district is thriving with competition, you have to offer the best and this place has the lines to prove it.
We were seated upstairs, the decor is nothing to write home about but on the other hand it made you feel at home.
Service was good.
We were taken care of by two to three ladies that were attentive when we needed them.
Once the food came it was all about the joys of sharing a delicious meal with family.
Absolutely loved the experience.
Cheers
Food was very average, compared to the price.
We took 17.99$ bowl where we get to select our own ingredients and they stir fry it for you.
I would like it more we could see how the chef stir fries it.
The service is average too, probably they were under staffed, we had to wait long for water, or to place our order.
They food ingredients counter were not very clean, however i was a staff cleaning it after that.
Decorated in red and black, the interior is good.
They used iconic chicago painting on the wall.
Around 100 people sitting area.
They've space to hang the jackets, which was very helpful.
Washroom was okaish clean.
This was my 1st time eating here; it was decent I feel like it was a bit too pricey for what is offered.
However I must say that service compensated
Very good and flavourful Asian style food.
Good vegetarian options.
Friendly.
Not much in terms of atmosphere.
Reasonable prices.
It‚Äôs a good place for those who want to customize their stir fry experience by adding your own sauces and flavors and ingredients.
The inside is lovely and you are able to choose separate meat or non meat in addition to adding all the Veges and ingredients that you like.
You also have an option to choose a pre listed ready made dish by the kitchen.
But I would say it‚Äôs more fun to add your own stuff and sauces.
The food came out cooked well and hot and the server brings it to your table once you leave your bowl and sauces at the counter.
The veges in the buffet style area were not super fresh but the variety was good as well as the sauces.
You can add scrambled  eggs or white cheese or extra bread to your dish for an extra $0.75 and they will add it for you when they cook your compilation.
One piece of Roti bread comes w the $17.99 per person meal (the one you choose your own stuff).
Overall a nice experience.
The reason I give it 5/5 is solely because of the elevator that they have (!!!
Great job) but as for the food ‚Ä¶ not all the veges were fresh and the bowl you add your veges to is very small so you can‚Äôt fit much in it (so add the sauces separately in plastic containers they give you on the side) and for this it‚Äôs $17.99 which I think is a bit pricey but it does include 2 meats which they add at the end separately and it was a decent amount).
So enjoy!
The wait staff were very nice and sweet.
There is an elevator inside the restaurant as soon as you enter for about 3-4 steps, which is really fine for people who need assistance with wheelchairs, which I haven‚Äôt seen in most restaurants anywhere in the world.
Great place if you are ink Asian , Thai ; you can make your own bowl ; there are many sauce options available .
The regular menu is also good .
DO NOt order Skewers - They are Bland with not flavor.
You can go with family to have a nice dinner after downtown trip.
Came here after work to grab a bite.
Start with chips with the choices of red or green sauces.
Nothing crazy here but the red sauce was the better of the two...it had more kick and taste that i typically like.
I ordered the beef burrito dinner and the burrito was bigger than I expected too.
Couple bites in and it was pretty decent...hit it with the red sauce next to get the full experience.
The red sauce gave it justice and I finished most of it before I got full.
Customer service was straight and definitely keep my glass full of water...I was not going to be dehydration here lol.
Overall nice spot not bad...there are better Mexican spots in the city for the price here.
7.1
Listen- this place is great for a quick bite.
I had to get my stupid passport and had 2 hours to kill- came here to have lunch and it lifted my mood right away.
The food was quick, the music had great acoustics, and the servers were dope- kinda like family friends cooking for you- the kind that knows how to cook lol.
I got 3 tacos and they were loaded and freshhh crisp lettuce- I would recommend coming in!
I would have taken a good photo but I ate it too quick üòÇ
asked for queso received white shredded cheese covered in red enchilada sauce, was charged 14 dollars for it.
main dish was sub par, could had been time of day 2pm.
I'm visiting from California and has been craving Mexican food.
I had Chorizo and eggs and it was delicious.
My husband had chilaquiles (green) and said they were delicious.
We were seated immediately and the food did not take long at all.
Very nice restaurant, family owned and managed.
You should try their steak chilaquiles with salsa verde.
Got reservations for a Friday night and we really enjoyed our meal.
The food was superb and the service was good.
Drinks also great.
It was a quiet weekend downtown before Valentine's Day so it wasn't packed and really just a lovely meal.
The ambiance is very relaxed and quite intake with several smaller sections to the restaurant.
We will definitely come back.
We had a pleasant experience at Roanoke.
We had a really long layover in Chicago so came into the city for lunch.
We showed up right at opening and were sent upstairs to the hotel area to eat.
The waitress was very friendly and nice.
All of the food was good but nothing stood out as spectacular.
When we left we understood why we were not allowed in the main dining room as it was full with reservations.
My wife and I just didn‚Äôt get why it was so busy nothing wild about the place just solid food at a little inflated prices.
I would go back if asked by someone but wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way for it.
My coworkers and I decided to have lunch there today, we have been dine here a couple times before with good experiences.
However, today we sat at the bar and Rafael as our bartender/ server, he was honestly the best!
He went above & beyond customer service expectations and has definitely  won us over as regulars.
We had the chicken buffalo pizza as he recommended and it amazing, 10 out 10!
We also had margaritas for National Margarita Day.
The presentation & taste was amazing.
The food & drinks excellent quality but the service was what sold us!
Overall, ok.
However, when they got my food wrong twice, it's a problem.
The waiter was nice and made my second meal again and comped it, but when a person hasn't eaten all day, it's disheartening.
I'd totally lost my appetite by then.
The manager apologized as well, but that was after we paid that hefty bill.
He was like, "I'm so sorry about your experience, please, come  back soon and give us another try."
Um....no thank you sir!
Went here for the first time with my husband for a date night before seeing the nutcracker.
Great experience all around!
We shared the Roanoke salad to start which was delicious, not overdressed, very hearty.
Then I got the rotisserie chicken which was moist and flavorful, and my husband had the steam frites, cooked to the perfect temperature (maybe could‚Äôve been a little more flavorful), but the fries were great!
I‚Äôm gluten free and this was no problem for them to accommodate, a lot of the menu items are already GF.
Good service, great ambience.
I would definitely go back and recommend!
After sports, my friend and I come here regularly for lunch.
Brown Bag is definitely my favorite restaurant and one of the most comforting places to be.
All of the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful, and their food is delicious.
I recommend trying the clam chowder and the gingerade at least one time!
This seafood restaurant is a great choice for lunch or dinner.
They offer a wide variety of healthy seafood options and boast a nice decorated interior inspired by the sea.
During our visit, we ordered the lobster roll and clam chowder.
The lobster roll was crispy, and the meat was tender.
However, I found the soup to be slightly salty.
Amazing!!!
Superb service, literally the best I‚Äôve ever had in Chicago, seated quickly with friendly amazing and knowledgeable server, food came quickly and tasted so good ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂ also we ate at the benches near the entrance so we had a super good view of the city  My friends and I got the make your own bowl and a shrimp and grits, sides of truffle Mac and garlic shrimp.
SO GOOD!
The grits were really creamy and the shrimp perfectly cooked.
I‚Äôd recommend the seasonal specials they have
I went to Brown bag today for my very first time and had the best experience.
Shannon took my order and was super friendly and provided the best suggestion for me to get their home made ginger lemonade.
I then received my food from Kamyah who was very friendly.
I then spoke with Jose and Von who were behind the scenes making food.
All of the staff was super friendly, making my first experience amazing!
I will for sure be back to get more food and visit the amazing staff!!!!!
Thank you!!!
!
So so good.
I got the fish and chips.
Fresh, seasoned just right, I will be back next time I'm in the area.
Very good authentic style German food.
The pork was great.
It had a nice smoked flavor and the sausage was bold.
The Wiener schnitzel was good as well with a buttery finish.
The interior of the place had a very timely and old world feel to it.
The different beers from the attached brewery are worth trying in one of their four beer flights.
Beautiful historic restaurant with delicious authentic German food and friendly staff.
I had the Sauerbraten with perfectly cooked veggies and they were accommodating with putting the sauce on the side.
Tasty and fluffy/crispy pretzel!
Decadent and dreamy flourless chocolate cake.
Best dessert I had while visiting the city!
I went to Chicago in April and I still think about that food sometimes.
It is peak comfort food.
Wraps you like a warm blanket after a cold rain.
The food is what I imagine a grandma would cook (I don‚Äôt have a German grandma but I picture her cuisine just like that).
I had most awesome soup, great cocktail and just enjoyed every bite.
This doesn‚Äôt happen too often to me  but I  just fell in love with that place.
Would want to go back to Chicago just to go there again.
Such a unique restaurant with great story.
We absolutely loved everything the ordered.
My wife couldn't get over how moist the black forest cake was.
My schnitzel was SO good and my son just loved the chicken soup.
We all can't wait to come back to Chicago to come back to Berghoffs!!
!
Great place!
Authentic German food.
Super cool atmosphere and history.
The entire Staff was exceptional.
Restaurant was clean and has so much history to it.
Def recommend it was phenomenal!!
Def recommend getting reservations as well it was packed when we arrived and when we left luckily we had reservations.
Great spot!!
!
This restaurant had an intimate feeling atmosphere.
It was just a touch too loud, so it was hard to keep up conversation with everyone at the table.
Our server was quick when she was at our table, but she seemed to disappear for long stretches at a time.
The place was busy but not overflowing.
The food was delicious though.
We got the fried goat cheese dip that was perfection.
So creamy and salty.
Just amazing.
I had the steak frites with fries.
My steak was cooked perfectly with a wonderful garlic butter.
The fries were crispy and good.
Restaurant was great.
I would definitely go back again.
Came by around 1 pm on a Tuesday and had lunch at the bar.
Probably only 7 or 8 other people dinning, and they were mostly in the back.
If you sit at the bar, you're right at the door, so expect a little breeze.
I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken, which came out to $20 before tip.
It was a good size and tasted great.
This is a sit-down restaurant (that also had some pick-up and delivery orders) that offers great service and friendly bartenders/waiters.
I'm not coming here everyday for lunch, but it was a nice treat.
I'll be back to try the ribs, which is what this place is known for
Feels like an old speakeasy.
It was suggested by a bellhop at the hotel we were staying at and it definitely didn't disappoint.
We went back for a total of three times on that trip to Chicago.
The crust is more of a cracker crust than a doughy elbow style deep dish.
The sauce was very intentionally flavored to be perfectly balanced.
All toppings we had were top quality and the amount of cheese was spot on.
I suggest this spot to anyone who asks.
I look forward to returning.
Per the suggestion of a fellow colleague, I decided to make my first meal while on a business trip in Chicago to be at the Exchequer Restaurant & Pub.
To be as transparent as possible, this was the best decision I could have made that day as my experience was nothing short of sublime.
Upon entering, I am greeted with a warm atmosphere: mellow lighting shines off of beautiful dark wood that line the walls and bar.
The aromas drifting from the kitchen are wholesome and inviting.
I am then greeted by a member of their friendly staff and escorted to my table, a quiet and comfortable place to dine.
After inspecting their rather delectable menu, I choose what I am craving and what my body needs after not eating for the past 12 hours: a Classic American Cheeseburger and Fries, along with their house Amber Ale.
Both my drink and my entr√©e are brought out in more than acceptable time and fashion.
The Cheeseburger was hot, juicy, and perfectly seasoned.
Their house Amber Ale had a background note of sweetness to it that was pleasantly delightful.
For dessert, I treated myself to their Cannoli, which came with 3 (only 2 survived to the photoshoot) and they were absolutely exquisite.
I enjoyed my time at the Exchequer, and if you enjoy great food in a charming and cozy atmosphere, then you will as well.
Cheers!!
!
Great Chicago style deep dish pizza.
Got an 8" personal sized with sausage and green peppers.
Yummy!
My husband got the 10" Chicago deep dish Meat and he said that was also amazing.
Highly recommend!
The group we were with also ordered fries for the table and even those were delicious - hot and crispy!
Will probably return to try something else before we leave town.
I went here with two friends after seeing a performance next-door at the Cadillac theater.
I had the striped bass and it was the best fish I‚Äôve ever had and I eat a lot of fish.
My friends enjoyed their meals as well.
One had the pork chop, and the other one had the Bolognese.
Our waiter was attentive and delightful.
Amazing food, service and ambiance.
The 3 course lunch special was outstanding.
Claudia was an awesome waitress and the entire wait staff was great even good old Richard.
Came for restaurant week lunch.
Oh god the food was delicious for me.
The medium steak was cooked to an med rare for me which was what I like the seasoning was on point.
One of the best lunch meal I had in Chicago.
But it seems their steak is very inconsistent as I came with 3 other people and their steak was cooked very rare even when we had medium.
Also the waiter I had was very rude.
And they were being passive aggressive after they wrongly billed my group.
I went here for dinner twice while staying next door at the hotel.
Both meals were excellent in terms of quality, portions and flavor.
I was staying at the hotel for the Chicago Marathon and having an Italian restaurant next door was just perfect!
The staff was wonderful, making great small talk, learning more about me since I was visiting and giving great recommendations of things to do around the hotel area.
They had a special "carb load" menu for the night before the Marathon which just showed me how much they cared about the visitors and what was needed.
This will be my place to go whenever I come back for the marathon or any other activity in Chicago!
Don‚Äôt skip out on this place, and definitely don‚Äôt skip out on the chicken.
Whoever is making the decisions back there is doing something very right.
The garlic mashed potatoes were immaculate‚Äîsmooth, creamy, flavorful, and buttery.
The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection, with juices oozing out.
The flavor was spot on and the pan sauce complimented the chicken wonderfully.
Only thing is the broccoli rabe was incredibly bitter, nearly inedible, so I suggest swapping out that vegetable.
The tomato basil soup was to die for, and if you get the martini, ask for blue cheese olives, because those olives were amazing.
Seriously, this place is legit!
They even had gluten free pasta for my husband.
The chef back there KNOWS what they‚Äôre doing.
Incredible food.
And I‚Äôm definitely a food snob.
Bravo!
A very solid choice for breakfast/brunch if you happen to be downtown on a Sunday morning.
The food was good (better home fries would make it very good) and the service was awesome - friendly with a smile.
It is a chain, but a pretty good one, so there were no surprises or let downs.
I really liked the UK pub atmosphere.
We ordered Manta‚Äôs Butter Chicken and thought it was a solid meal.
Couple of takeaways, the curry was a bit too creamy lacking flavor and the breads were a bit bland too.
All in all, the chicken was tender and it was a nice meal worth trying.
Don‚Äôt get me started.
I stayed in Chicago for the week- I was on the hunt for the best bar to spend my evening.
I explored Chicago for a couple evenings and E&C is by far the best.
Great prices.
Brilliant happy hour.
Great customer service and staff.
Doesn‚Äôt get any better.
Met great people around me at the bar.
I might‚Äôve spent 3 evenings here throughout my week in the city!!
!
Fun spot for some English pub vibes with an American twist.
Wouldn‚Äôt call it a dive bar.
Menu has plenty of British pub staples, with the bangers and mash and pies being especially tasty.
Draft beer options are pretty strong, with an emphasis on Midwest craft.
Obviously touristy but would still return without hesitation.
We came here on the day we got our marriage license back in 2022, and it has been on our rotation ever since (partly because of the good memories, and partly because we love this restaurant!).
The British pub atmosphere is very welcoming and unforgettable, the food is great, the cocktails and beer don't disappoint.
Overall, it's more than a solid choice if you are in the city and want a mix of a fun dining experience and a nice place to relax after walking around all day!
We recommend The Old Speckled Hen on draft, the fish and chips, bangers and mash, butter chicken, and the berry ginger mule!
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Remington's.
The atmosphere was pleasant, and the food was exceptional.
The prime rib hash for brunch was a highlight with perfectly poached eggs and lean prime rib.
The steak salad impressed with deliciously seasoned and crust on the steak slices.
The French dip and fish sandwich received high praise from both my mom and dad.
Overall, a delightful dining experience with great food variety.
Additionally, the attentive visit of the manager, who came by to check on us, added a nice personal touch to our dining experience at Remington's.
It's always appreciated when the staff goes the extra mile to ensure guests are satisfied.
I went here with coworkers on a Monday for Chicago restaurant week lunch and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how amazing this place was.
The hostess was accommodating when I told her there was 6 of us instead of 4.
They sat us in a beautiful room with glass walls lined up with wine bottles.
Our server was attentive and personable.
She provided amazing service.
The food was incredible.
I had the salad, burger and brownie and they were absolutely delicious.
I definitely will bring family and friends back here again.
For the first night of my stay in Chicago, I was looking for a place to grab dinner that was within walking distance from Millennium Park and had great reviews, and that is how I found this place!
Upon entering, the staff was attentive and guided my mom and me to our table (which faced the busy street with plenty of views for people to watch).
The server served us water immediately, and we got our drink order in less than one minute.
Given that the restaurant was not busy yet for dinner time, in less than 10 minutes, the dinner crowd started to pick up in this restaurant.
The ambiance of this place was inviting and cozy.
There were still Christmas decorations here and there in the restaurant, which added to the pleasant atmosphere of the place.
I ordered a gimlet and their house burger, which was super delicious and juicy with the perfectly cooked burger meat (I ordered medium rare), and my mom ordered their fish of the day option.
She also enjoyed her meal and finished everything except for the last bit of her fries.
We ordered a skillet-baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream for dessert.
It was the perfect dessert to end a delicious meal.
My mom and I enjoyed our time here for dinner, and I highly recommend this place if you are ever in Chicago.
A bit pricey but so many places are anymore.
Had a special cup of soup, didn't realize we could've ordered a bowl (tiny cup), and each ordered a different salad.
He shared his chicken as I didn't realize my salads primary protein was bacon (my fault).
They were both great and kept us mostly full til 5.
My partner and I visited for Chicago restaurant week.
10/10.
We were running a little bit late and still got seating pretty quickly.
We got the deviled eggs, the filet mignon that‚Äôs paired with a loaded bake potato.
My partner got the chicken paired with mashed potato‚Äôs and a side of Mac and cheese.
I will say my filet was a little overcooked in my honest opinion but it was still delicious!
For desert we got the carrot cake(not pictured.)
The service was great and the server was really helpful.
I definitely recommend this spot
Great stop for lunch after a morning of walking!
Good price, good amount of food, shrimp fried fresh in front of you.
This is a fast casual place a lot like Chip Oh Telay.
But the food is so so much better.
The baja chicken burrito is what you need if you have some serious business to attend to later and want power but not fatigue.
The three taco combo will delight you 3 times a week as you can mix and match.
It is my favorite fast casual place in Chicago.
I wasn't impressed with Burrito Beach.
I ordered ground beef tacos and they didn't have much taste.
The tortillas were soggy and when I picked up the taco it disintegrate, so I ended up.eating the filling with a fork.
I don't see myself returning to Burrito Beach.
I have to say that besides the food the service was good.
Great üëçüèΩ Food & Great Service... Everyone That Works Here Have a Great Attitude Towards The Ppl that come here to Buy food.... ps.
THE chorizo & Egg Burrito üåØ is Too Good üëçüèΩ
This used to be our favorite spot in Illinois Center On Thursday‚Äôs.
Our paint shop used to call it taco Thursday.
Well we went December 1st.
They cut down the size of the tortillas by a lot.
6‚Äù.to 4‚Äù and the girl actually is counting the amount of steak pieces she puts in the tortilla.
Would have paid a higher price for the same amount of food before.
Now the same price for less.
GOOD BYE.
Stopped for lunch.
Food was cold.
The whole place was also dirty.
Do they even have a cleaning person?
Got charged for two bowls instead of one and a chicken shawarma.
I didn't notice until we left.
It was okay.
Probably won't return.
We ordered on online.
Got Chicken shawarma for protein with a side of 2 falafels.
Lets just say, the "chicken" was non-existent.
I think there were like 2-3 teeny-tiny slivers of chicken in the entire bowl.
I will say the flavors and sauces (there were 3 sauces) were excellent.
We grilled our own chicken on the side and had the bowl.
Overall: Good taste but if your looking for a meal with a descent amount of protein, this is Not it.
Quick take away order.
Wonderful beef and chicken with rice platter with Arab bread.
Couldn‚Äôt wait to try NNG.
Look forward to trying again.
Food platter was delicious.
I ordered a veggie feast.
Though the order took sometime to be delivered, I loved the food.
Restaurant is easy to notice as it is located right across the street.
Not very crowded.
The falafel and pita is very delicious to eat along with the platter.
Will visit this once again for sure üòä
(-) small portions and very limited range of toppings (2-4!!)
none of them really exciting (+) ingredients tasted relatively fresh, the pita was fresh too  The concept is not well executed and I won‚Äôt be coming back
The food was all delicious!!!
Service was quick and pleasantly nice.
Our order came out quickly and it was cooked to exact perfection.
The staff ran amazingly smooth and efficient.
I have nothing negative to say about our experience.
Very pleased.
We ordered 2 eggs over easy with toast and a 3 egg omelet.
Waitress took 15 minutes to even acknowledge the line of people waiting at the entrance to be seated.
Once seated the waitress did not introduce herself or apologize for the long wait.
Upon ordering my spouse had a question about the price listed for steak meal.
The waitress apologized we were giving the wrong menu‚Äôs.
So, please ask for a newer menu.
(They are the ones with the plastic sleeve.)
We also had to ask for a glass of water, which was never refilled.
When food arrive it was was warm and correct.
Our waters were never refilled.
We had to find the waitress to ask for our check.
We ate here for breakfast because it was conveniently located across the street from our hotel.
The breakfast food was very tasty: eggs, omelette, hashbrowns.
The coffee was excellent!
Along with the service!
We sat in a booth with a window and had an excellent view.
They serve Heinz ketchup.
An average (good) breakfast-lunch diner.
Very contemporary design scheme.
Interesting floor tile design with a big black-and-white mural on the far wall.
Average (good) food.
I had the "Butt Steak Special" (sirlion "steak", two pancakes and two eggs) minus the two eggs but still paid the full price.
It is on a side street with not much of a view.
I won't avoid coming here again but won't seek it out.
Lizbet was our waitress.
I had to ask her name to get it.
It took about 25 minutes to get our food for a party of two.
It was  sitting on the counter.
I'm glad it was still hot, but my sausage was burnt.
Someone else brought our food out to us.
She did not check in on us while we ate our meal.
I had to call her name to request to-go boxes.
While the location offers a fantastic view of the Art Institute and is conveniently situated, the food quality at this fast-food restaurant is awful, and the service is very, very slow.
The salad consists solely of lettuce with a very small portion, and the burger is extremely tiny and tastes mediocre.
Considering the price, this place doesn't offer good value for money at all.
If you're seeking a relaxing spot, this location might serve that purpose well, but I wouldn't recommend it for the food quality.
Personally, I won't be returning and wish the location hosted a different restaurant altogether.
30 minute wait on an app order.
This was the second time this has happened.
When I finally received my order, I was disappointed at the portion size of my side salad.
It was 4.79 for barely any lettuce.
I should also mention that I placed the order early (11:35) hoping to avoid a lunch rush but it seems like it did not matter.
15 minutes into the wait, there were a ton of students who placed orders at the counter and we were all in the same boat of waiting.
We had a very nice day walking the streets in downtown Chicago - enjoy the lively sidewalks with lots of people.
Naturally we became hungry from all the walking.
Our choice for lunch, mostly by luck, was Chick-fil-A on S Michigan Avenue.
This was the first time we tried CfA, and we were quite pleased!
The fried chicken was mmmm-crispy, very tasty and the special fries was both creative and delicious.
Despite the location on a busy street, the atmosphere was calm and the facility clean and comfortable.
Much to our delight, the manager stopped by our table and told us a little about starting the fast food restaurant here.
It appears that advertising outside is restricted due to the building being historic.
However, the business was doing well - which does not surprise me.
The value for money here is good and the choices are satisfying, both if you are very hungry or just want something tasty and light.
I enjoyed a crispy chicken sandwich with fries, my wife chose chicken nuggets and in here opinion the meal at Chick-fil-A may have been the most enjoyable during our two week trip in the Midwestern states.
We hope you will enjoy a meal here as much as we did üòâ
This is trashy to be serving this to customers while they pay $4+ .. wish I saw this before walking out of that store.
Moldy fries is what the company is selling now?
!
Millennium Park.Urban In-Line (# 04485)) Chicago, IL  I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the level of customer service I experienced during my recent visit to your establishment.
As a loyal patron of your restaurant, I have always held your establishment in high regard.
However, the events that transpired during my most recent visit have left me feeling undervalued and disheartened.
Upon placing my order for a chicken wrap, I specifically requested sauce to accompany it, Instead of accommodating my simple request, I was informed by the manager (Aysegul), that he had a new policy in place, charging customers an additional fee for dressing.
This policy was not communicated to me prior to placing my order, and I found it to be both unreasonable and unjustified.
Furthermore, when my order was eventually served, it was incorrect, further adding to my dissatisfaction.
When I approached the cashier to rectify the error, she provided false information about my order, which only exacerbated the situation.
It was only after the intervention of another manager that the issue was resolved, and I was finally able to receive the correct order.
The most disheartening aspect of this experience was the attitude displayed by the manager (Aysegul), who not only failed to acknowledge the mistakes made but also engaged in argumentative behavior, insisting that the customer is not right.
Such behavior is unacceptable and does not reflect the level of professionalism and courtesy that I have come to expect from your establishment.
As a valued customer, I believe it is important to communicate my concerns in the hope that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
I urge you to review your customer service policies and ensure that all staff members are adequately trained to handle customer inquiries and complaints with professionalism and respect.
I sincerely hope that this letter serves as a catalyst for positive change within professionalism and respect.
I don‚Äôt often review restaurants and I‚Äôve never raved about a salad online.
Nor is salad the first dish that comes to mind when you think of Chicago cuisine.
But, my friends, the Watermelon Heirloom Tomato Salad here is heaven.
Sweet Watermelon, peppery Arugula, smooth heirloom tomato, firm, high quality feta, and a tart vinaigrette.
It‚Äôs just splendid.
I completely cleaned my plate.
The rolls are also very good.
I appreciate the variety of flavors and styles offered.
For those who drink adult beverages, the Old Fashioned was also delectable.
The service was capable and the atmosphere at the Palmer House was vibrant.
Whether you‚Äôre visiting from across the world or just stopping in after work, I recommend Lockwood and their lovely salad.
Cannot get over how good this burger is ü§§ the Palmer House lobby is incredibly beautiful to sit in.
Great place to people watch.
But OH all I‚Äôm thinking about is the burger.
I ordered it medium well and it was perfect.
So peppery!
Will be back for that for sure.
This place is amazing!
The food, the ambiance, the service.
It's a great place to relax.
Have a great meal.
Chill with a drink in a beautiful lobby.
Our server was Christian, and he was absolutely on top of everything and was excellent.
The atmosphere dazzles!
As a teenager, this hotel lobby was one of the places I loved to bring my friends.
We‚Äôd walk through and admire the beautiful old hotel lobby.
Now I can come here to have drinks and sit and truly soak in the atmosphere!
For the price of the drinks, I‚Äôd say the service is lacking‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs possible they are understaffed.
I‚Äôve been here a couple times for drinks and seem to always arrive after the kitchen closes!
Stayed at the Palmer and had dinner here, I was exhausted and starving but the Lookwood restaurant was the perfect option.
Ambience was soothing and luxurious, food was absolutely delicious.
I had the green salad with grilled salmon and it was just perfect!
Good was delicious!!
So let me tell you a little about myself.
When I am new to a place, I always try to get the best for less because I am trying it out.
It just so happened that at this restaurant the best for less was the turkey melt, which happened to be what I actually wanted anyway so that right there already made me feel great.
That turkey melt was amazing, ate it so fast couldn‚Äôt even get a photo ghhhhheeeezus.
Now I admit it did take a little while to come out however, the bartender Candice, as well other employees made sure that I was comfortable and let me know the reasoning.
Candice, the bartender was absolutely amazing.
She gave suggestions and the drinks was actually great.
My homegirl ended up getting the salmon bites as well as the salad and those were also amazing.
You know I had to get me some üòÇ.
Definitely 10/10 the prices aren‚Äôt that bad especially for what they are located.
Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
Photo of my home girl food
Today me and my friend went to the L Station Chicago after work.
It was our first time there and when I say they did not disappoint.
The atmosphere was a vibe, the owners are so super pleasant and sweet, they checked on us, made sure our food was okay and the server we had was so super sweet.
Baby the drinks was too good, the food was top notch, and their portions are just right.
The whole experience was even better than I expected it to be.
If you‚Äôre thinking about going here to eat stop thinking and just GOOOOO.
The L Station Chicago is definitely 1000000/10 I can‚Äôt wait to go back.
So today is my 49th birthday and me and my family picked this place because they are black owned and first we called and they said they don‚Äôt do reservations because we are a party of 6.
Then we arrive at 6.30 pm and they tell us it‚Äôs a hour and a half wait.
We were outdone.
When the waiter taking waitlist told us if we put up a deposit we could have had a reservation, really we weren‚Äôt told that.
As an African American family we try to support black businesses but this place was very misleading.
We waited a hour and 40 minutes and then an other hour for food.
The only good thing about this place was the drinks.
I think it‚Äôs very frustrating when you see the chef go get milk because they ran out of products.
They assured us the wait will be worth it but unfortunately they lied.
We are born and raised and Chicago and  uncle John‚Äôs barb que is way better than the turkey tips I had.
When do bones go in turkey tips?
The Mac was horrible and the mash potatoes were from a box.
The lamb chops Mac was cut up like pull pork.
My birthday this year was ruined due to the lack of service the unprofessional service and nothing but a round of drinks for the inconvenience.
I will never come back here again and will tell everyone not too if I can.
# horrible!
Oh ps my daughter never even got her yams!!!
Check please.
They actually want to charge a service charge!
I think not!!
Oh did I mention the waiter told us we need a bigger kitchen so they bagged up!!!
Really were is the professionalism in this place.
No decorum!!!
The LLC Patterson family needs to be reestablished because they won‚Äôt last long!!!
!
From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was amazing!
We were greeted by the staff immediately!
One of the owners(the brother) told us about the menu and what to try!
The other owner(the sister) walked in and was very friendly as well!
Our bartender/server was friendly, nice and explained the menu and drink selection to a T!
The food was the bomb!
I‚Äôm from the south and I was skeptical at first, but when I say everything was good‚Ä¶ I MEAN  EVERYTHING!
We all had a different dish and there were no complaints!
I had the jerk turkey tips, Mac n cheese and yams!
ThIS will be our spot on each visit to the Chi from now on!!!
!
Everything was perfect except the wait time!
The food and drinks were really good.
Came out with my family and they only had one high chair which was in use.
So our baby had to go in a regular chair.
She‚Äôs two so it wasn‚Äôt so bad.
Everything was reasonably priced and we will return.
The quality of the food outweighed the wait times.

This was my first time trying Chick-fil-A as a tourist and I was blown away - great tasting Spicy Deluxe burger with the right crunch and flavor, and oh man, the waffle fries was to die for with its slightly crispy exterior and mushy interior.
Devoured the entire meal so quickly I wished for more.
I'll definitely be visiting more Chick-fil-As!
7/6/23 Chicken sandwiches and food are good, but the restaurant was very crowded and limited in space.
Yes, there were plenty of places to sit and eat, but the tables were in close proximity and not friendly for people with disabilities as far as space goes.
It's hard to maneuver walkers and rollators through the restaurant because the tables are so close together.
But the place is clean, employees are friendly and courteous, and they get your order out fast.
Prices aren't too bad either, about $12 per meal.
I have a bone to pick with their ketchup packets, though.
NOT DISABILITY FRIENDLY!
Their extremely hard to open, the tabs hard to pull off.
If you look at the photo, it says the word "pull back and peel."
I am sorry to say, there was nothing to pull back.
The foil was completely flat.
And the white tab at the end that you're supposed to pull off, was difficult to manipulate, too.
I had to take a pen and stab the ketchup packet to get it open.
Please bring back the old-fashioned McDonald's ketchup packets, the kind that you can actually open.
These new packets look great; I'll give it that, they look jazzy and cool.
But it does no good if you're fighting with it for ten minutes, especially if you're disabled, lack strength and have severe arthritis in your hands.
Very clean, friendly, and  quick service.
Usually, I second guess eating at a fast food placein the city, but I even liked how they had security.
THE SECURITY GUARD IS ABSOLUTELY RUDE AND DISGUSTING‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all he do is sleep and shush ppl when they‚Äôre talking like we‚Äôre two in the lunch room‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think he deserves to represent Universal Security nor should he interfere w any of the customers here.
I am utterly disappointed and absolutely tired of getting out of class to come and spend money at a CORPORATE restaurant to be treated unfairly and w hate.
DO NOT eat here!!!!!!!!!
Enjoy food on Michigan BYPASS state!
Love coming here each time I come to Downtown, I always get a Deluxe with pepper jack cheese.
and the Waffle Fries are so amazing and also the Nuggets with a Large Mac n Cheese.
I was pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem.
We stopped by before our show at Civic Opera.
The service was fast and food even better.
They have a great bar if you don‚Äôt have time for a dinner, but I can highly recommend to try something from their menu.
Also, the view is amazing!
My family and I had such an amazing experience at Rivers Restaurant this week.
The food was exceptional and the service was beyond compare.
Yartiza, our server was very attentive, she made us feel welcomed and made great suggestions.
The food was very fresh and delicious, definitely a great experience.
We will be back and highly recommend Rivers Restaurant.
The host and wait staff were amazing.
But the food was not good.
The Scottish salmon was overcooked.
That dish was the special that evening, and you would think it would be cooked to perfection.
It simply wasn't.
And the jambalaya was so heavily spiced with black pepper that it was the only thing I could taste in the dish.
It left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth for hours.
The only good food items we had were the appetizer salads.
This restaurant is a miss, and a huge disappointment.
Good service.
Friday lunch was not busy at all and sitting outside was great as you can see the boats passing by the river.
Food was not bad.
The asiago encrusted scallops might be the best scallop dish I've ever had.
Service and views exceptional.
Rotisserie chicken, orzo rice, baba ganoush, whole wheat pita pickled onion and peppers, cucumber and tomato, tatziki and spicy fea ü§å Less than $13!
If you're sick of your food being treated like no more than a material to sell, come here.
So fresh, and so much flavor in every bite.
It was hot and super quick.
Perfect weekday lunch spot.
Also a great option for tourists looking for a quick, casual, satisfying lunch.
I ordered the chicken kebab pita with a side salad and unsweetened tea.
It was very good!
The staff was very nice  :)
Food is phenomenal and great value for the money.
The feta cheese covered fries were incredible with the squeezed lemons.
Love this place!
Worth coming to for authentic delicious Greek food!!!
‚ù§
Really skimped on the toppings.
food does not match the photos online whatsoever.
Really disappointed.
Go to Taza instead, it's nearby like a block or two away and much more generous.
I like the owners, the employees, and always love the food.
My biggest complaint is that 9 out of 10 visits this place is always filled with smoke.
It bothers my nose, my eyes, and makes everything I'm wearing smell for hours.
All that I know is on Friday's  - they have THE BEST Fish Fried sandwich that I have ever had!!
It is definitely worth it!
!
Was rotten
Unique vibe for the loop.
It's got that cozy, dated, red-checked tablecloth vibe of a neighborhood bar.
I stopped in at the end of lunch on a weekday.
It was pretty dead, except for people at the bar.
I slowly walked up to the bar since no one greeted me and I didn't know what to do.
The unapologetic bartender came up to me pretty soon after from the back and took my order.
She seemed annoyed that I was there or that I wasn't a regular or both?
Or maybe it was because I asked what kind of beer they had?
I got a cheese pizza that came pretty quickly.
The pizza was good- the sauce was mildly sweet with just the right amount of herbs.
I'd definitely order it again.
Great food & cozy atmosphere.
I had the pleasure of being introduced to the son of the owner.
Nice guy!
Additionally most other patrons were friendly & willingly engaged in conversation as if you known them for years.
Menu prices are reasonable, food is flavorful & service is an easy 4 star!
A great place in every aspect & a must to visit again.
Great local place!
Red checkered table cloths and a very nice waitress.
I ordered the buffed beef sandwich.
It was very tasty but a little small.
Fries were great!
Colleagues had an Italian grinder and a hamburger which they said was great.
Enjoyed the lunch experience, thank you!
Came here for the first time today.
It wasn't busy and I seated myself at a small table since no one was upfront or said anything to me.
I ordered after a bit of waiting.
I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich.
The bread was nice and toasty and fries were good.
I couldn't help but feel rushed because the waitress asked me if I wanted her to wrap my sandwich and fries when I hadn't been there long.
She seemed like she was in a hurry the whole time (which I can understand if it's super busy but it wasn't).
I don't think I'd go back because of that.
Customers don't want to feel like they have to leave.
We were next store at the Skybar celebrating a retirement of a fellow friend and I believe the owner of Bono Vino was stopped through.
He bought us a pizza and it was awesome!
I have sent friends in for pizza and they also enjoyed the atmosphere and pizza!
I would suggest you give them a shot.
They are open late and next to LaSalle Street Station.
Absolutely delicious food.
I saw that the average rating for this restaurant was a sky-high 4.9 across thousands of reviews, and I have to say it‚Äôs completely deserved.
The skillet cornbread came in a hot iron skillet hence the name, and featured a perfectly crispy exterior while soft and fluffy inside.
There are bits of real corn as well as the slightest hint of spice which adds nicely to the flavor.
A scoop of butter was served on top, tasting rich and creamy but didn‚Äôt feel fatty.
I am not exaggerating when I say the Wagyu Short Rib melted in my mouth - it was genuinely just that tender.
The pairings featured pickled onions, white cheddar grits, whole carrots, and mix of other trinity vegetables with the grits.
Everything tasted amazing, and service was speedy as well.
Grilled flat iron steak is good :) friendly staff and lots of seats!
still good to reserve table ahead of time so they can prep and get you seated faster.
Food to a bit of time so prepare to wait a bit or ask them to bring anything that‚Äôs ready out first.
Aspiring Decor, Luxurious Vibe, and Fancy Food Presentation üòã.
My family walked into this gorgeous restaurant for lunch.
The place was packed with the diners.
The restaurant is located on the ground level of JW Marriott Hotel in Austin.
My wife immediately recognized the beautiful interior inside.
We were seated pretty quickly.
It was a bit loud inside as there were a lot of guests utilizing the bar.
It would make a great place for a date night.
For a family restaurant, probably ü§î...
I would have given Five Stars for service if the table that we sat was clean.
Obviously, they forgot to wipe it down.
I hate ruining my shirt with the food grease...
Nonetheless, the staff were awesome and professional.
The brunch hamburger was great.
The house salad was a hit dish.
Their house seasoning was fantastic.
The prime steak wasn't terrible, but I wasn't a fan.
My kids had taco meals and hated it.
I have come to find out that my Austin friends do not have sophisticated taste buds (come on now we Texans care about our food!!!
), so I am thinking that their food might actually be the top rate for them....
The food was better than average.
Very friendly staff.
Located right downtown.
Nothing to complain.
The Ceviche was very good - the Albari√±o was 2022 harvest and had ‚Äúvery matured notes‚Äù - better possible ‚Ä¶
Amazing experience!
Our server Gary is the best!
He even gave us tips of great places to explore here in Austin (as it is our first time here)!
Having fun here already - thanks Gary, we feel safe & relaxed (not to mention how exciting it is to find out more about the City of Austin).
And this restaurant ‚Ä¶ Well,  we will definitely come back!
Ok, I went here for lunch on a Saturday.
Place was quiet.
Sat on the rooftop.
Very chill.
Jackie, our waitress, was awesome.
Food came fast.
Chips and salsa while we waited.
I had the Mexican Meatloaf.
It was really, really good.
Mexican.
Mexican mashed potatoes to go with it.
It actually tastes better and better as I ate it!
The corn was kind of tangy but it went really well with the Mexican Meatloaf.
It's a little on the pricey side.
But the food I got was excellent.
I can't imagine expecting more out of a restaurant....except cheaper prices.
Ha!
We arrived and sat at the bar.
It took about ten minutes before anyone took a drink order.
When the bartender took our order we ordered food as well.
It was several more minutes before drinks arrived (canned beer).
It was another 20 or so for food to arrive.
We never got chips and salsa, and no one even stopped to check if we needed anything to ask to order some.
The stuffed iron burger and fries weren‚Äôt good.
My honey had the shrimp tacos, also very good.
Seems the kitchen has their stuff on point but the rest of the folks, not so much.
First thing, Our Server, Danny served us well.
We tried Shrimp tacos, baja fish tacos, chicken fajitas, Paella, and vegan taco.
The shell of the tacos weren‚Äôt fresh however all tacos except baja fish were good.
Paella was also good.
Good place to dine in at 6th street!
Great food!
Great drinks!
Waitress seemed annoyed to serve us one second, fake politeness later.
She even warned (judged)  us when we ordered our meal that if we ordered the (very yummy) tableside guac we wouldn't get it until after our entree so we should wait to order the entree...   um no thanks.
Took you 30 min to get back over to the table...and it wasn't that busy  Also, came on a Sunday late afternoon for the rooftop and it was closed (because they "only open it on weekends.... except they closed it that afternoon").
But people watching by the window was at a premium!
Definitely worth a return but probably will sit at the bar to avoid the snark!
Top rec?
The wranglers were amazing!
And the Chile rellano was phenomenal!
I recently dined at Iron Cactus on Trinity Street in Austin, TX, and it was a delightful experience.
The bartender was fast and accommodating because I was pressed for time.
The ahi tuna sandwich blew me away, and the lobster tacos were equally impressive.
The restaurant's iconic status in both Austin and San Antonio is well-deserved, offering a warm, unique environment and delicious Mexican cuisine.
Can't wait to return!
Stonelake area was amazing experience for an Austin, Texas vibe.
Accommodations were gladly and graciously accepted for our seating area with an infant.
The staff were prompt for refills without myself or my family even noticing we needed another refill for water.
This is is exact atmosphere for having a wonderful time for the atmosphere of the party.
I saw couples outside drinking wine by the fire pit, some on the balcony, some cozy in a booth, larger parties seated for 20 people, the bar happy, and my baby was with her family happy as could be.
Wonderful experience!
Salad iceberg was overflowing with food, fish tacos were not greasy as other places I visit.
Chips were not over salted.
This place is FANTASTIC!
My new favorite is the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin!
You really need to make reservations but if you wing it like I did, you can get the full menu at the bar and bar sitting area.
Great atmosphere, service, food and drinks!
Came here for a last minute birthday dinner after the previous place was unexpectedly closed.
And oh my goodness we had the most fabulous time!
They really know how to take care of guests!
Perfect place for a celebration dinner!
Also their happy hour looked amazing, will be coming back to check it out
Sweet potato old fashioned was phenomenal.
Beef fondue was the perfect appetizer for this hangry chick.
Had the 8oz filet for my main as well as a side of the green chili Mac n cheese.
Both were out of this world.
Finished off with the Mexican vanilla creme brulee.
Fantastic service and amazing food.
Food was disappointing, we ordered 50 day aged steak bone in ribeye and it was no good, no aged taste at all.
I could make better at home to be honest.
Service was fine but the waiter messed up our order of sides which was super simple as we asked for 4 things.
I would not recommend this place.
The place is in a nice section of town and a nice building, the atmosphere and placement are good.
My Thai has always been one of our family's favorite spots to eat.
The egg rolls were different a while back but I'm happy to say that they are back to the originals, although a bit smaller but still great.
Their Lemon Chicken is the best I've tried.
They also have some new items added to their menu.
They are closed between 3-5pm for a break by the way.
Just received an Uber order.
I paid extra for vegetables in both dishes, but there were none.
Small portion on the Pad Thai with no vegetables and the dish is very dry.
The Musmum also had no extra vegetables and the flavor is odd/uninteresting.
Incredibly disappointed and big waste of money.
I got the pineapple fried rice and my friend got the chicken pad Thai.
The food was so good.
It has a great atmosphere too.
I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with Chicken for takeout.
It was ready quickly and was hot.
The flavor was savory and spicy.
I‚Äôd definitely return, dine in and try other items on the menu.
They were so wonderful and welcoming to us after a long day.
Their tofu is amazing and they have the largest Thai Tea servings I have experienced.
I got so excited about the green tea ice cream with edible flowers on it that I forgot my wallet; however, as I live in Dallas (we were there for a day trip), I called them when I remembered and they offered to mail my wallet to me.
Thankfully, I will be receiving my wallet soon.
Amazing service and kindness!
Will be going here every time I visit Austin!
:).
Visited on a Friday evening but got a table to dine in within a few minutes.
Ordered the Japchae and Spicy Chicken entree dishes and they were both excellent.
They have the option to make the dishes spicy and I'd recommend trying that out.
Ambience and service gave out the good downtown Austin vibes.
Everything we tried was delicious.
Working out the ordering system was interesting but the learning curve was steep.
Friendly staff.
The Miso spoup with a Dumpling was awesome.
The Obake bowl with Tofu & rice medallions was delicious.
We also had the Teriyaki chicken and the regular Obake bowl.
We will be back.
Fantastic find!
The vegetarian bowls at this cafe are a true delight.
Each bowl is packed with fresh, vibrant ingredients and bursting with flavor.
A perfect spot for a healthy and satisfying meal!
The food here is delicious.
I was in Austin for a conference, recently, and this restaurant was within walking distance of the convention center.
I had the Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna (cooked medium at an employee's suggestion even though I normally eat it rare), miso soup, and peach ginger tea.
They give great portions and the food was delicious (I didn't take a picture before I dug in, unfortunately).
I was also eyeing the Lemon Pepper Papaya salad, so I decided to go back again the next day.
That was my absolute favorite and I added salmon to make it more filling.
The restaurant is quaint with indoor and outdoor seating in the heart of the city.
The service was great and they gave me a complimentary miso soup the next day, I assume because I either came back two days in a row or because I brought new folks with me the second time.
Either way, it was appreciated.
If I'm ever in Austin again, I will definitely be back.
This use to be one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite to eat.
Unfortunately, the Google listing says you can dine in.
This is not the case.
They never reopened their dining space for eating.
I definitely will not be coming back here again.
This may as well be a food truck.
You can choose to eat out in the scorching sun in 100 degree weather on their back patio with a fan that blows hot air into your face.
The quality of the food has definitely declined.
The noodles tasted super burnt.
The lettuce they added to one of their plates was also gross.
Crazy delicious food!
The tastes are well-thought out and layered wonderfully.
A BLUEBERRY pesto panini sounds ridiculous but was sumptuous.
The bay windows are excellent for people watching.
Cannot recommend it any higher.
Delicious fresh food!
The Budda bowl was a great vegan option.
I am feeling full and happy.
I bought the pepperoni pizza for my toddler.
She liked the small amount of food she consumed.
Service was great, restaurant is clean and I would like to come back.
Came here in the last 30 minutes of operation hours, and still got an amazing experience.
The guy who took my order at the register was polite and got a couple laughs out of me!
Food was definitely fresh and delicious!
Decided to eat here before going to the venue.
I had the Blackened Chicken Mango bowl which came with rice and quinoa, mango, kale, black beans and chicken ofc.
That was one of the best bowls I've eaten.
The ingredients were fresh and this bowl was definitely filling.
They also have cane sodas, tea and lemonade.
I had a Berry Hibiscus tea that I mixed with lemonade.
It was the perfect blend of sour with a bit of sweetness.
While we were there, a homeless man came in to get something to drink.
However, they yelled at him to get out.
I don't know what history they have with him but the interaction was loud and upsetting.
The food was decent but the portion sizes were small for the price.
The sandwich came with half a handful of chips and the soup was TINY.
The restaurant blaring music so loud it was hard to have a conversation.
They should definitely turn it down to improve the vibes.
They didn‚Äôt have an abundance of vegan options for a healthy lifestyle restaurant.
So today was my second time enjoying the happy hour that Stella on fifth Street offers.
They have a bunch of options at five dollars each, two big plates at $15, the deal is great one of the best ones in Austin.
The happy hour includes both drinks and food which is awesome.
Milena, our server was so sweet, I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt hate us after only ordering from the happy hour menu, but your girl is trying to stay on a budget!
First time we were there, Giovanni at the bar was also great at making drinks, and super awesome customer service.
The staff is very welcoming, they made the experience all the more enjoyable.
I hope this happy hour never ends, it‚Äôs a great spot for a date night.
Standard hotel restaurant - the food was nothing special.
I had really high hopes based on the reviews, but nothing impressed me.
The fried chicken and waffles were okay, but the chicken was too mildly seasoned for me.
It didn‚Äôt taste like much, but I could definitely feel the oiliness in every bite.
We also got the avocado toast, which was fine too but we had to add an egg to complete the dish for ourselves.
The biscuit was good but not exceptional.
I can think of a half dozen better spots for southern food, fried chicken, and brunch food in Austin.
Nothing differentiated this spot for me.
You‚Äôre better off skipping this spot unless you‚Äôre staying at the Westin and it‚Äôs more convenient for you.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
I wonder if its great reviews are due to being attached to a hotel.
No complaints about the service.
Our server was great but the food took very long to come out.
My steak was so salty it was not edible.
It was also overcooked, I ordered a medium steak and it was well done everywhere except the middle was medium-well.
The drink I ordered tasted like pink lemonade.
I could not taste the individual ingredients added in.
The skin on my husbands chicken was slimy and chewy but at least the flavor was good.
The biscuits were the best part of the meal but not a reason for us to return and give this place a second try.
Some of the biscuits smelled a bit overcooked at the top.
Our server Logan was very good.
He kept our coffee filled even when the restaurant running low.
If you are in Austin this place is worth stopping by for brunch.
We had the lemon pancakes and the salmon Benedict.
Logan suggested having it with avocado which was an excellent idea.
Our pancakes were good although I am more suited to traditional maple syrup and lots of butter.
Although they were cooked to perfection.
The salmon Benedict was awesome perfecr for brunch.
The coffee was excellent and to my surprise was Starbucks brand which I am not usually a fan of.
I loved the hashbrown it had a slight cheesy flavor and was very thick and cooked to perfection.
This is a must stop if you are looking for a trendy spot to dine particularly for brunch.
Food was awesome (try the biscuits!).
Armando was our server, great, very attentive and super cool.
Great vibe, food was awesome, would definitely come here again and try more of their delicious looking and sounding menu items!!
!
It's was my 1st time here.
I celebrated my anniversary, and it was great.
Our server, Audrey, was amazing and spot on with her recommendations.
There's so much we wanted to try, but we'll be back.
The food was good, but with great service, the experience was stellar.
The table was decorated and had a card.
We also got a special dessert and souvenir photo as a keepsake.
If you're in Austin definitely plan a visit here ask ask for Audrey, she'll take extra special care of you, and I hope she sees this.
Food => ùü¥/ùü≠ùü¨ Ambience => ùü¥/ùü≠ùü¨ Customer service => ùüµ/ùü≠ùü¨ Quality Price Ratio => ùü¥/ùü≠ùü¨ .
Very good restaurant!
The hostess was great, and she changed our reservation to an inside table.
And she put on the table a very nice Birthday decoration.
We started on the bar, waiting for our table, with a champagne bottle.
You can eat on the bar, great!
I'll come back.
Our server, instead there wer a lot of people, was efficiently and professional.
They serve a bread basket and salty butter at the beginning, which are delicious.

Always it's available always we order.
And this is on the top five I ever taste on a restaurant.
Hand-chopped beef with a lot of flavor.
I liked serving all ingredients separately so you can mix at your taste.
Awesome!
ùóßùòÇùóªùóÆ ùóßùóÆùóøùòÅùóÆùóøùó≤ Very good.
With avocado and cucumber.
In my opinion, it is better without cucumber.
Bit spicy.

No!
Why do you aged a piece of beef, cook perfectly, tender and juicy meat, and then you put a shallot butter sauce?
If you it serves separately, you could taste the beef, the sauce, and then you can mix if you want.
The meat was awesome.
Sides: parmesan truffle fries, poor, bad, frozen... not good.
Roasted wild mushroom, maybe with less rosemary flavor would be better.

Very good food, variety, great wines, good service staff, nice decoration and illumination.
Prices are not exaggerated.
I'll come back soon, sure!
We celebrate birthdays with our best friends during the year and this was by far the best dinner and celebration that we have had!
The food was perfect.
The drinks were amazing.
The atmosphere with our friends was outstanding!
January 20, 2024 still awesome üòé 5 stars ü§©
Beautiful location both outside and inside.
The service was great, our server was very knowledgeable and attentive.
The steak was cooked to perfection, from the outside and temperature wise.
The mashed potatoes were rich and not too buttery.
Oysters were also tasty as well.
My wife and I had an amazing dinner here on our trip to Austin.
Chris was an amazing server who really went out of his way for us.
The food was amazing especially the calamari and the new skillet hash browns with caviar.
Highly recommend the porcini rubbed bone-in ribeye of course.
Thank you Jasmine as well.
Food was very well flavored.
Their short rib fried rice is amazing without all the workings.
The sushi is great too.
Our server was very sweet even though she was training someone and even helped us navigate our way through downtown.
Atmosphere was pleasant but overall unremarkable.
In my opinion, every hotel has its uniqueness, some are so beautiful that they leave a lasting impression, i.e.
the Marriott in New York.
I stayed in an older hotel recently, Embassy Suites in North Charleston, the one drawback is they didn't have charging plugs in the common rooms downstairs.
In this day and age, that is a must to be able to charge your devices, but what they lacked in certain modern conveniences, they more than make up for in their Continental breakfast BEST EVA!!!!!!!
out of all the hotels I've stayed in in the past 7 years....BEST HANDS DOWN, the fancy 5-star hotels CANNOT measure up to their breakfast...in my opinion
Kat was an amazing server.
Such a sweetheart.
Very engaging and attentive to our needs as customers.
100% recommend.
Thanks for the excellent service Kat.
PF Chang's is lucky to have you on their staff.
Best wishes to you!
We loved it.
We don't reside in the US Amy more and we're happy to find out that after so many years this chain is still great.
Food was delicious.
Orange chicken, beef broccoli, dumplings, rice, all was excellent.
The cheese cake was also amazing  And our French waitress was super nice!
Meh.
I was attending a conference at the convention center.
Got there about 11:10, only a few tables were sat and one person at the bar.
It was still a 35 minute wait for one.
Seemed very unorganized.
Asked if I could see at the bar and they said oh yeah that would work.
Service was SLOW!
The bartender did not like to give the lunch menu which was a great deal but everytime she gave someone their menu she left it out.
Probably won't return.
Food was okay but not the best.
This place was absolutely amazing!
I had the brisket tacos and my honey had the alambre‚Ä¶ both were very good.
The queso was better than average, and the salsa was perfect!
The mangonada was good, if margaritas ar your thing.
Best thing about Micheladas was the patio.
Perfect weather and friendly staff made for a great time.
Visited our first night of our trip to Austin TX, we sat outside and I ordered a Negra Modelo.
The Cantina was busy, but service was still very fast, I got Brisket Tacos and my wife got a Vegetarian enchilada.
We both really enjoyed our meals, and then we bought and shared a tres leches cake, they did a super job with presentation and the taste was perfect!
If you‚Äôre looking for a good Mexican restaurant this is it.
Table side guacamole was delicious, service was excellent (someone was checking on you frequently), and main dish (pastor tacos) was very good.
My only complaint is the credit card service fees, these need to stop everywhere now.
Omgoodness, this was the best Mexican restaurant üòã here in Austin!!
The chicken enchiladas were cheesy and  had huge chunks of chopped fajita chicken.
I also had pinto beans and Spanish rice, which was well seasoned and very flavorful.
Fresh chips' extra crispy and homemade salsa not crazy spicy or chunky!!
My server was attentive and checked on me several times to make sure I was happy!!
The atmosphere was great and music festive.
I will definitely come back when I visit Austin!!
My new goto spot!
!
The food, service, and ambiance was 5 stars all the way!
If we were local I'd absolutely go here all the time.
Food here is decently priced and the burrito that I ordered was big.
But, the flavors are so-so and the rice is very hard/crunchy.
I would not return for this, there are too many good options around.
Standard tacos.
They are fine.
The service and food were good.
My partner and I had stumbled across this restaurant while searching for a coffee shop, but we were pleasantly surprised by this location.
Not only was it a cafe, but also a bar and a restaurant.
We decided to share a meal that caught our attention which was the Banh Mi tacos, and it was the perfect fusion of Vietnamese and Tex Mex cuisine.
I highly recommend trying this dish out if you were to come by here!
I will say though, the matcha latte made me sad due to it not having a matcha taste like I expected, but it was still a nice tasting espresso latte with subtle sweetness.
Love everything here: Tacos BANH MI - interesting combination between Mexican and Vietnamese food.
The vibe is very Texas,  everyone is attentive and friendly.
I know I am gonna say something obvious - Tex-Mex / Mexican food in TX is wayyyy much more better than anywhere else in different states, even though there are several huge Mexican communities in North America.
Will be back!
Went for the Drag Brunch.
It was awesome!
The patio is also super cool.
The brunch I had and the Margarita flight was great.
The servers were really rocking it on a busy Sunday.
Kriston and Don were great üëç Super appreciate you guys ‚ú®Ô∏è
Was referred by local hotel.
Was a quiet day in the restaurant.
Informed by waiter that they did not receive a shipment of chips.
Provided my party with a mix of chip crumbs to eat our appetizers.
Noticed a long hair in the salsa.
Staff was apologetic and replaced.
Later, we found a long gray hair in the guacamole.
Apologies again was told that it would be taken off our bill.
No manager ever attended to these issues.
We decided to leave.
Great restaurant with amazing drinks, food was authentic and full of atmosphere!
Very close to the Moody Center, has become a favorite of ours before a concert.
Super cute casual diner restaurant in downtown Austin.
Very clean interior with friendly, chipper staff.
You order at the counter and then your food is brought out to the table.
The prices are high, but everything in Austin is now ridiculously expensive.
I had the Smoked Salmon sandwich ($18).
It was good but had unnecessary ingredients like carrots in it, plus a less than sensational avocado spread.
Thin slices of fresh avocado would have been much better.
My date had the Winter Power Bowl with grilled salmon ($29).
It looked great and he liked it, though the salmon was overcooked unfortunately.
In closing, it's a good lunch spot if you work or live downtown.
Love the patience and genuine friendliness of the staff, and the food was good!
You can tell thought was put into texture and taste.
Nice and casual spot for your omnis, vegetarians, vegans, and gluten abstaining besties.
We got two sandwiches and two cookies.
The sandwiches were good.
I wish they didn‚Äôt assemble it with wet stuff touching the bread because upon delivery, the bread was soggy.
The smoked salmon sandwich is loaded with delicious dill and pickled onions.
The veggie sandwich has a curry flavour to it which and loaded with veggies so you will not be hungry after.
I really enjoyed the kettle chips too.
The cookies are thick and do not look like the pics on DoorDash.
The miso cookie really does taste like miso, if you‚Äôre into that.
Nothing we ordered was outstanding but it‚Äôs definitely a solid spot for healthy eats.
This is one of my go to lunch spots when downtown.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of the chicken crunch sandwich, but you can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu.
There‚Äôs a huge selection for those that are health conscious as well as vegetarian.
The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is super cute with eclectic mid cent mod decor.
All staff I‚Äôve interacted with has been kind as well.
Recently tried brunch and ate myself full as I couldn‚Äôt stop.
Yes!
I love local foods.
I‚Äôve been to just about every location and they‚Äôre all bomb.
My recommendation is the cashew queso, taco salad, and carrot cupcake.
All items are vegan and absolutely scrumptious!
Food was fantastic I recommend the beef dumplings.
If we had a bigger table we would have ordered more food.
Our server could have come by a little bit more often for more cocktails, but otherwise it was a nice experience.
We came in about 20 minutes early for our reservation and were seated shortly after arrival.
The whole staff I looked nice and acted professional.
If you come at night it's going to be pretty loud due to the bar being very overcrowded next door.
Amazing atmosphere for a date night.
The food was delicious, just be careful with the hidden charges.
The dessert menu with the wine pairing is unintuitive.
The price with the wine pairing is only for the wine and it's added onto the desert price above it.
There's also a ~3.5% wellness charge by default.
Besides that the pita bread was super fresh and the chicken breast kebab was delicious.
The wild grouper was ok...
The fish wasn't as good and it was too salty, but the spiciness was on point.
What a great place with truly tasty food.
The Mezze plate was a savory treat.
The smoked salmon was perfect.
The dips paired well with the pita / bread which was so fluffy and warm.
The dining room has eclectic wall tiles and comfy chairs, it‚Äôll keep your mind engaged.
Service was top notch too.
Last note, the French toast was to die for, it was a sweet cloud.
The Peacock is a nice Mediterranean restaurant boasting a lovely interior and outdoor patio where you can enjoy vibrant and delectable dishes.
Overall, the experience was wonderful; however, in my opinion, the food is a bit overpriced.
Despite this, we enjoyed our meal, and I highly recommend trying the Beef Short Rib Shawarma Hummus, a delicious appetizer for your dinner.
The Yogurt Marinated Chicken Thighs were perfectly cooked and seasoned, juicy, and complemented well by the sauces served
This is one of the best Mediterranean restaurant in Austin with lots of Seafood and Non veg options.
The ambience is vey nice.
The staff are attentive and the service is very fast.
We ordered Lamb Kefta , Khachapuri and Toasted Almond Muhammara.
The dishes are colorful.
The Non veg food is tasty and yummy where as the veg is not up to the expectations.
The Desert Dark chocolate so delicious.
Definitely we will visit again
It was our first time having it as we are tourist.
It was well recommended so we had to give it try.
The server explained to us what it is all about and how to build our own meal.
Even my 6 year old enjoyed the experience.
Our meal was fresh and delicious.
We really enjoyed it.
The only negative is the street people coming and roaming around.
My son was a bit scared.
Other than that we had a great time.
I just work around that block and I recently enjoyed my quick dinner at Chipotle, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations.
The freshness of the ingredients and the customizable options make Chipotle a top choice for a quick and satisfying meal.
The staff at Chipotle were friendly and efficient, making the ordering process smooth.
The cleanliness of the restaurant added to the positive experience.
The atmosphere was lively, creating a great vibe for enjoying.
no cheese... can you believe that?
no cheese... the employees seemed indifferent to it... they had cheese, but wouldn't use it since it wasn't shredded, and the shredder was broken... just an awful experience
Went there for dinner while in town for a wedding.
Got there about 8:45pm and they close at 10.
The girl behind the counter seemed annoyed that she had to stop her end-of-day cleanup to take my order of a chicken bowl.
As I looked at the meat trays they were all empty except for a few dried up pieces.
I commented to her that it looked like they were out of everything but she said there was enough there for my chicken bowl.
She was actually going to send that to me!
I politely said no thank you, went to Culver‚Äôs and had a great meal served by a very polite and well trained staff.
Got extra barbacoa for my burrito bowl and they charged me $5.55 for it.
I‚Äôve never been charged for a little extra protein at any chipotle.
It doesn‚Äôt say anywhere on the menu that they charge for extras and I wasn‚Äôt informed of it until after I told them I usually only pay $12 and some change for a bowl so after paying almost $20 for a bowl, I‚Äôm not going back to that location.
Amazing!
Looked at the menu and options and decided this was a place to visit and we were not disappointed.
The location is easily accessible and had very friendly and attentive staff.
The set-up of the restaurant was nice, inviting and comfortable.
The food was delicious and worth a visit again and again.
Lobster rolls, seafood gumbo, Dr. Pepper Steak Sandwich and bread pudding.
Awesome.
Went for breakfast when they opened at 9 am and we were only 1 of two tables in the place.
The service was great, the food was excellent, and the portions were more than enough!
Was so good we wanted to go back for supper!
Let's start with service.
Ian was a great server, shared his recommendations, and was warm and personable.
The food and presentation was amazing, better-than-expected, for the price range.
We had: Beignet Fritters (complimentary), Biscuits and Gravy Benedict, Eggs Benedict Arnold, a passion fruit Mimosa and a delicious spicy Bloody Mary.
Fun tip: If you get a Mimosa, add some of the Beignet fruit topping.
It sweetened it up, added to the flavor, and it was entertaining to watch the fruit bubble around the glass.
Overall, a very nice place for brunch and we would definitely return for more.
Great menu and okay atmosphere.
Although the restaurant didn‚Äôt have the menu item first requested (seafood gumbo), wrong entree brought to the table without correction (server apologized for the kitchen confusing (the fried shrimp blue plate which we ordered, with the coconut shrimp ordered by another table) and shrimp were not fully cooked on stuffed shrimp entree, we enjoyed the crab cake appetizer.
The side item of creamed spinach was good, as well as dessert (bread pudding), which they left off the sauce.
Not a good experience during our visit.
Oh wow this place is awesome.
Possibly the best Seabass I‚Äôve had in quite a while.
With asparagus and rice.
Very good great tequila collection had a nice heavy on 44.
And the oysters were spot on.
Recommended highly.
Overall good experience.
Server was attentive and helpful.
Double cheeseburger was good and came with large serving of fries.
Only complaints were they have no mustard in the restaurant and it was cold but I would go again.
Went to eat last night by a friend recommendation and I‚Äôm glad I took it, for just a sports bar it had great food.
The server Amanda was very sweet and helped me pick out food for me and my wife.
Everyone looked very nice, the hostess didn‚Äôt even make me wait for a table , got me one right away even when they looked busy
Our server Anthony B was not only professional and helpful he was funny!
Chelsea was so accommodating to me when I asked for a copy of a receipt from 2 nights prior.
Great staff!
Ate at champions tonight, Amanda was our server and she was amazing!
She recommend great food and drinks.
Will definitely come back for her service
Our waiter absolutely sucked!!
We were with a party of eight and the waiter took our drink order and then we waited 15 minutes to take our food order.
The runner brought our food to the table and never saw our waiter again.
No one checked on us until I went to the hostess and asked to see a manager.
The manager came over and spoke to me and said she would talk to him.
After about ten minutes he literally dropped our checks onto the table and left.
Awful service and a lousy experience!!
A
The restaurant is beautiful inside and it's huge.
It was very clean.
The service was friendly and fast.
We had chicken pesto and chicken Parm.
The pesto was good but a little more lemon flavor than I like.
Bread appetizer was delicious.
Overall it was a good visit.
It was pricey for a lunch though.
One cocktail, 2 meals, and 1 appetizer of bread was $100.
The bartender was friendly and funny.
The outdoor seats provide a good spot to enjoy a meal/drink as you take in the small part of the city.
The wait staff were polite and ensured I was comfortable.
The chicken pesto I had was delicious and well priced.
We visited this location for brunch, for two cocktails and two entr√©es it was about $100.
Food was good but still a bit pricey for breakfast food.
Have been to the domain location as well (for lunch and dinner); overall the food is good at both locations so would consider going again!
Lovely dining experience.
Been there recently for a cute date night and it did not disappoint.
We ordered spicy rigatoni in vodka sauce, chicken parmesan, their famous truffle garlic bread and tiramisu.
Everything was prepared fresh and they were very accommodating of any food restrictions as well.
Our server helped us guide through the menu for vegetarian and gluten free options.
Will definitely give it a try again.
Oh did I mention, they have the best tiramisu!!?
ü§§The chocolate wafer balls on top were a nice touch.
Don‚Äôt be turned off by the (squid ink) black pasta, it was delicious.
Service was great.
Place was clean and inviting.
Plenty of parking in the garage for a fee.
Had me a Groupon to come use.
Was it worth it.
Check this little spot!
After taking a stool or working out or even after grocery shopping come stop on by and get authentic Mediterranean cuisine!!!
I order the Habibi Falafel Wrap that comes with fries, Pita, and Baklava!!!
You must check this little slice of life out!!!
Pricing is easy on the wallet also!
This used to be an amazing place to eat.
My last order was over $50 on a delivery app, and everything was wrong.
And, gross.
The red sauce was ketchup.
The chicken was greasy and mushy.
Special requests for leaving off an item was ignored.
Plus, the poor driver had to wait an additional 45 minutes for the order...it took them 1.5 hours to make my order.
And - look how tiny the $4 fries is now.
Used to be great - but I'll stick with Kismet from now on.
Food, price, and service are all why I keep coming back here.
Not to mention the Tuesday and Thursday Stand-Up comedy at 9pm.
Now I bring all of my friends here.
There's outdoor seating.
Food ready in less than 7 minutes usually.
They told me that they do not use seed oils which is a plus.
They customize my meal to my specification each time with a smile.
Thank you!
The people are good, but the food quality has degraded so much over the years.
Marginally stale chicken, and mundane gyro.
Portion size was soo small that I was forced to complain.
Prices have sky rocketed owing to location I am assuming.
But need to complement that with quality.
Don‚Äôt rip off office goers.
Good good but I ordered online for pick up and it turns out restaurant was closed.
There is no way to get a refund.
Not sure why they even allowed the order to go through
I can't tell you enough about the great food quality and service here.
Fresh and high-quality food with a touch of creativity.
They made my anniversary celebration possible on such short notice.
The only miss was the fact that the kitchen closed at 11pm and at 11:06 they couldn't serve any dessert!
Very disappointing experience overall.
We were excited for our first meal in Austin!
Multiple mediocre items.
Food served on visibly greasy plate ware.
Server was constantly in a rush, forgetting items.
But crab croquettes were delicious and the hostesses were really warm and welcoming!
Top notch, highly recommend for a date night or any other occasion you're thinking of.
Bistro Steak Fries was amazing and the Spicy Tuna Bruschetta was packed with so much flavor that we couldn't stop talking about it after we left the restaurant!
Sarah T. Was a phenomenal server!
After a very terrible dining experience, we walked out of a restaurant hungry and a bit defeated.
We stepped into Corrine and WOW!
From service to the food, we had a complete mood shift!
Sarah was very personable and recommend a bottle of wine for the table‚Äî which paired well with all of our food.
She also encouraged to add scallops to my pasta dish and BEST DECISION EVER.
The scallops were so amazing, my husband and I couldn‚Äôt stop raving.
We enjoyed them so much so that the chef came out to meet us and proceeded to tell us that their line cook made them.
Hats off to the line cook!
You all made our night so much better.
THANK YOU!
Loved the service and food at Corrine!
Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and our food arrived quickly.
We came here twice in one day - happy hour and dinner - and we were not disappointed.
What a hidden gem right here in the heart of Houston.
Within walking distance from multiple hotels.
Great food, great service, and really nice atmosphere.
We had the smoked salmon crepe and the breakfast burger.
Large portions and super delicious!
Everything is fresh and the flavors are well balanced.
Had the cappuccino also and they are so delicious!
The coffee croutons, aka sugar cubes,  are amazing!
Fresh bread brought to the table with butter was a great start.
We finished out the meal with the fine apple tart!
Spectacular!
Great service from the waitstaff!
We will be back!
It's located by Discovery Green and in the same building as Phoenicia with an attached garage parking.
I have been here a few times for lunch when I'm in the area.
Always friendly service and easy to get a table.
One of my favorite item on the menu is the smoked salmon crepe.
It comes with a small side salad.
Portion is great for a not so heavy meal.
Overall, a cute brunch place in Downtown.
The atmosphere of this place was wonderful.
The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable and also very accommodating-someone in our party has allergies to certain things and they went above and beyond to be helpful.
The food was delicious but in all honesty, nothing really stood out.
The food was cooked well.
The chicken breast was moist, but not very flavourful.
The mashed potatoes stole the show for me.
I could have eaten a whole bowl of them
Authentic French Restaurant.
We started with chucuterie board and had a good variety of everything I like.
Had plenty for everyone and not cheated.
The atmosphere was elegant and nice.
Very good for date night with low lighting.
Decent prices for a high end restaurant.
The escargot was buttery and tasty.
The mushroom risotto and added shrimp.
It was a rich and creamy and cooked just right.
Shrimp not overdone.
The duck was tender but kind of a small portion.
The sauce was a miss gor me.
Not very tasty.
The spare ribs we tender and falling off the bone.
Just needs a bigger portion for what you pay for it.
Overal.
A good experience.
This was our first visit to Brasserie Du Parc.
The restaurant is bright and welcome was pleasant.
The server introduced himself quickly and brought water and fresh, warm, & delicious bread.
The bar menu had a good selection.
We ordered an appetizer and main each.
The tuna tartare was solid but maybe missing some onion.
My asparagus salad was phenomenal.
The asparagus was cooked to perfection and served with plenty of prosciutto, egg, & balsamic.
My husband's entree was the catch of the day, sole served with lump crab and roasted vegetables.
The flavors were enjoyable but portion was a tad on the small side and the fish slightly chewy.
My entree was Coq Au Vin served with mashed potatoes and carrots.
The chicken was flavorful and fall of the bone delicious.
The service overall was friendly but a bit slow with seemingly only two servers in the entire dining room.
This is an good choice if you are headed to an event in the area.
Excellent & convenient location for the Toyota Center.
Wonderful experience at La Fisheria!
Anita was knowledgeable and on point with the menu, checking in on us frequently.
Both the tamale and grilled octopus with garlic were amazing.
In fact we have never had such flavorful tamale before.
Only downside is that the bisque wasn‚Äôt what we had hoped for it to be.
Too salty and bland.
Needs more lobster in it.
Also, it doesn‚Äôt appear that there were too many dishes worth trying on the entire left side of the menu, according to Anita.
Would be great if the restaurant can work on some of these to bring more dimension and flavor to them.
I highly recommend this restaurant I went there for a first date/birthday and the ambience was great.
The food was fantastic.
The weight staff was very attentive, and met our Every need they even Went extra mile to make my dates birthday.
Perfect.
We had the octopus on the parilla and the trio tacos, seafood tacos.
So if you‚Äôre looking for good seafood, Mexican, seafood and great ambience, great staff and a place to take some takes extra step for you.
This would be highly recommended guys.
with their service and food quality.
We have been here a handful of times and it‚Äôs always spectacular.
Our waitress, Ana, was especially friendly and very attentive.
Great service is worth coming back  for.
Tonight, we ordered the trio of ceviche and shared an off the menu 2lb snapper.
The snapper comes with your choice of 3 sides and tortillas.
We like spice, and our waitress Ana was kind enough to offer us the habanero oil to add to our food-be careful!!
It‚Äôs spicy but so perfect to spice lovers.
The trio of ceviche is a nice portion and all three of them are fresh and flavorful.
Equally enjoyable was that snapper on lime sauce!
Wrap it up in a tortilla or eat it off the plate‚Äîeither way it‚Äôs delicious!
Thank you La Fisheria, and Ana for a great dining experience.
Came here with my husband for dinner.
The servers and bartender were very attentive.
We ordered a ceviche starter, the corn tamales, and mojarra.
The food was great, reasonably priced.
Our waitress Anita was super friendly, we really enjoyed eating here.
Absolutely amazing!
Staff was extremely friendly and the food was some of the best I have had in Houston.
The seafood was fresh, the flavors blended together perfectly, and the entire meal was exceptional.
Can't wait to go back.
The food was delicious!!
Packaging was simple and lovely and most importantly the delivery bag was stapled.
Simple steps to ensure less possibility of food being tampered with during delivery.
Thank you!
I really enjoyed the pork belly fried rice.
Highly recommended.
After discovering the Underground Hall, we decided to try out food from here.
So we ordered from Wokker.
We ordered Pickin' Chickin' (Asian style chicken nuggets topped with fried onion, jalapeno, curly fries and miso ranch) and Shaken Beef (beef filet mignon w/ steamed rice topped by onions, tomatoes anf fried egg).
The chicken was crispy and savory.
The beef was juicy and tender.
Delicious food.
The lively atmosphere enhances the whole experience.
Will go back there again for sure.
Wokker, located in the "Underground Hall," was a great visit.
The food was absolutely delicious.
A little on the spicy side, but well worth all the flavors.
The "Chicken -n- Greens Dumplings" didn't sound appealing to me, but I was greatly surprised.
Moist, tender and seasoned deliciously and served with Plum Sauce (you know, the Orange Sauce that's usually served in a packet with Egg Rolls), that's served fresh.
I highly recommend ordering the Dumplings!
I made the mistake of ordering 6 Dumplings; I should have ordered the 12 count.
You' won't be disappointed.
As for the "Jalapeno Bites," extraordinary!
They have their own twist on this popular appetizer, as it's Cream Cheese, Garlic, and chopped Jalapenos, wrapped in a Wanton, like a Crab Rangoon.
Talk about filled!
Here to they are served with Plum Sauce.
As for my main entre, the "Smoked Chicken Fried Rice," the portion size was very good.
Now, this entre does come with Kimchi and a Fried Egg.
However, I happened to forgo those 2 items from my entre.
Finally, there is the beverage.
$4.¬∞¬∞ may seem a bit high, however you are talking about Downtown.
The plus being, by ordering a Fountain Drink you have free refills.
Being that this is a Dining Hall, all the other eateries sell individual cans, bottles, etc.
But, no free refills.
The Wokker is the only one that has free refills on their Fountain Drinks.
Now then, as for the 4 stars.
The, "Underground Hall," is exactly that, underground.
With that being said, this Dining Hall is not Handicap Accessible.
There is no Elevator provided.
And the Staircase is the only way, in and out.
Upon entering, you'll find a sign that reads: "No Public Restrooms."
Don't let that fool you.
They do have Public Restrooms indoor, albeit, and yet ironic, with a Handicap Stall.
Last but not least, be sure to bring a Credit Card.
As all the Establishments inside do not except Cash.
Wokker is located in the Underground Hall which hosts numerous restaurants.
Wokker is an Asian style restaurant with some BBQ influence.
I got the pork belly fried rice.
Food did have a nice bit of heat which had me sweating slightly.
The kimchi was well cooked.
Pork belly was juicy.
Good portion of food for the price.
Well the rice is delicious but the pork belly isn't crispy at all.
First time eating totally soft pork belly.
Also the "chef" doesn't want to talk to customers but he's in the front so how would I know he wasn't the cashier.
Also charging $5 for fountain soda is literally robbery.
There's no way tap water and flavored syrup should cost that much.
Very nice restaurant and the food was way better than I expected.
I started with the buffalo ü¶ê, and this was super good.
Since I was already in shrimp mode I then had the bacon wrapped ü¶ê which was to die for!
Next time I'll probably embarrass myself and just get a double order of the bacon wrapped ü¶ê.
The service was ok, it seemed hard to get the servers attention, however what I believe was a manager came a few times so that made up for the server.
Nice place, great food, will for sure come back.
üëèBacon üëèWrapped üëè Shrimp
Upon a recommendation from the concierge, we visited hearsay.
We ordered deviled eggs and meatballs to start.
Absolutely phenomenal and recommend!
Entres were great as well.
I chose the scallops while others chose fish.
Both were delicious.
Our server was polite and provided great recommendations for us.
The restaurant was busy and quiet enough you could hear others at the table which was nice.
I‚Äôd definitely return.
Stopped in for a late dinner not fully sure what to expect, but everything came out great!
Both the host and our server provided awesome service, and the food was better than we expected.
Looking forward to our next visit!
Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner was wonderful.
The food was impeccable, and our waiter was friendly and attentive.
Will be returning in the future.
The only reason the experience was not 5 stars was because the tables were so close together you were practically elbow to elbow with the strangers at the tables beside you.
üòê
I went for a quick and late meal on my own and felt super welcomed.
I was well attended and had a delicious salad but what was the best part was the roasted poblano soup!
It was literally life changing.
I have never had this type of soup before and it impacted me so much I am now trying to make it at home.
Highly recommend!
We had a great experience at Aquarium Restaurant celebrating my son‚Äôs 8th birthday.
The food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is amazing with the front table view of the fish tanks.
Steve the manager came by to see if everything is okay and made some recommendations on the dessert menu.
üòä Erma provided us great customer service throughout our meal.
It‚Äôs amazing place to hang out for lunch or dinner with a truly amazing atmosphere.
The dessert options were out of this world.
The chocolate wave.
üòò Definitely will make this a special place to visit.
Great place, with good food and atmosphere!
Everything we ordered was very good.
They do have a kids menu.
It is a little pricey but it's worth it for the overall experience.
There is also an amusement park with rides and games on the property.
The Aquarium Restaurant personifies excellence in all areas:  1.
Outstanding service 2.
Stunning ambience 3.
Absolutely delicious food 4.
Courteous, articulate, and talented employees  Grade: A+
Excellent service, food and atmosphere.
It‚Äôs an outstanding experience to have dinner in front a huge water tank.
It‚Äôs great either using the valet parking or the regular parking.
After touring the Aquarium with my family, we decided to grab a bite to eat at the Aquarium restaurant.
We got an appetizer, a kids meal, and dessert!
The service was amazing and the food we order was pretty good.
The dessert was amazing!
Today I have dinner in here.
The Pad Thai noodle is wrong, they must use the right type of noodles.
But the taste is good compared to others restaurants in America.
However, the waiter chased us to ask for tips.
(?)
As an Asian, I just pay for the food I ordered and we don‚Äôt have to pay anything else for the waiter because they bring us the food and keep asking ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù for tips.
The waiter keeps saying like he doesnt earn any money because we don‚Äôt tip.
In Asia, we have exceptional service but they don‚Äôt do that for tips, they do that because the standard is high and they are trained to treat customers as a king because customers come to their restaurant.
Tip is optional but in here they acted like I have to do that.
Nothing exceptional, our standard is high, so I don‚Äôt tip.
Please training your employees well.
The employers should pay them, not me.
I came here for dinner and from the start it was exceptional service.
Our waiter was Jay and he made us feel like our business truly matter.
He was attentive, kind, and very helpful.
The food was great and you could tell everything was made with fresh ingredients.
My husband is in a wheelchair and the tables were a great height.
There was a slight ledge to get in and Jay actually got hands on and helped him into and out of the restaurant.
This is the type of business that you should go out of your way to support.
I will definitely be coming back!
My friends and I had an exceptional dining experience at Thai Cafe last night, and it truly exceeded our expectations in every way.
From the moment we stepped in, the beautiful ambiance and welcoming staff set the tone for a remarkable evening.
The restaurant not only showcased a gorgeous and inviting atmosphere but also an extensive menu of authentic Thai cuisine.
Each dish (and appetizer!)
we ordered was a culinary masterpiece bursting with vibrant flavors and exquisite presentation.
The Pad Thai was a definite highlight, my favorite of the night.
What truly stood out was the impeccable service we received.
The staff went above and beyond, catering to our every need with attentiveness and genuine hospitality.
They were knowledgeable about the menu, accommodating to dietary preferences, and offered insightful recommendations.
Our time at Thai Cafe was nothing short of fantastic.
It was a delightful culinary journey.
I cannot wait to return as soon as¬†possible.
Contented smiles, full bellies, and memories of an evening filled with excellent food and impeccable service.
Highly recommended for anyone seeking a truly exceptional Thai dining experience.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Exceptional Thai food.
My wife and I have tried many places in Houston and this is easily one of our new favorites.
Try the Spaghetti butter garlic shrimp  and the salmon curry.
You won‚Äôt be disappointed
The food was delicious!
Also, staffs and service are very nice.
On top of that, I was so lucky today.
The owner was so kind.
She gave me a new menu to try - it called ‚ÄúKhaw Soi‚Äù which is an authentic Thai noodle bowl.
Counter-serve spot inside the food court at POST.
I stopped in on New Years Eve around 9 pm.
There was a bit of a wait in line, but the items I wanted were on the food line.
I did the quarter chicken with rice and added on chicken curry.
The chicken in both was super tender and full of comforting flavor.
Every bite was so good.
The price is fair being inside the food court.
$15 for the food, but the $6 I paid for the water was crazy.
I would go back for the food.
I lived in the Middle East for 12 years.
My wife is from Iran.
We will both tell you this was the most authentic Mediterranean food we have had in Houston.
The lamb shank I was served was absolutely wonderful.
I read some of the reviews complaining the prices were high.
Go compare the price and quality of this food to any other Mediterranean (or Iranian) restaurant in Houston.
Another review complained about the garlicky mayo sauce.
That reviewer obviously had no experience with authentic Mediterranean food because garlicky mayo is absolutely traditional.
My complaint elsewhere is in not finding it available.
We left completely stuffed.
Take any negative comment with a grain of salt.
Do yourself a favor and try this unlikely diamond in the rough.
I will say they should feature the lamb shank prominently so people see it when they walk up and look at the visible dishes.
Lamb shank is on the menu but is not on display.
Arabella!
Put that lamb shank on display!
It needs to be showcased!
I was so hopeful as I love a good chicken shawarma wrap.
The chicken was good but it was just slathered in sauce.
The sauce was a more Mayo-like garlic sauce than I was used to.
The fries we just ok but nothing to complain about.
As many other have said, it‚Äôs pricey for the quality.
If I ever try it again, I would go with the plate since the chicken did have good flavor.
Possibly if I got the sauce on the side or said light sauce it would have been better.
Portion size was good though.
I‚Äôm sure other things on the menu would likely be tasty, I was just let down.
Stopped by today for lunch with my wife, ordered a gyro not the meal just the gyro and a top√≥ chico,  once I arrived home I noticed I had a charge for $23!
The young guy at the register never gave me a receipt so I was unaware of the amount I was charged.
The gyro was rather small by any standards, not to say it wasn‚Äôt delicious.
My wife and I were asking ourselves why the place had no patrons at the time we sat and ate and now we know why.
We‚Äôre from NYC where prices can be a bit on the steep side but $23 dollars for a flour tortilla wrapped gyro that resembled a taquito and a topo chico is just robbery in my opinion.
Hopefully this was a big misunderstanding and the owners mediate this situation.
Kind of disappointed this with this place.
I understand the costs of being in a new location.
Yet it is paramount  to provide an appropriate amount for the food for the amount.
Tell me is it worth 15.24 when you get essentially four decent sizes chunks of chicken breast on your plate?
I honestly don't think so.
To be fair, the food tasted pretty good.
I only got this because I was told there was no beef kabab option (17.99) available at 11am on a Sunday.
The chicken chunks were decently grilled with a sight tartness from the yoghurt marinade.
Rice was pretty good, and firm.
The tobuli was missing white onion.
I didn't mind, but the lack of it was noticable.
To their credit, the estimate of 15-20 min to cook the meal was on point.
Yet for what I received, it is unlikely I will go back.
Ate here for lunch a couple days during a recent conference.
Did not have any issues with my orders.
Tasty food for an exceptional price compared to the rest of the area.
It was very quick both instances and the staff was friendly.
I like my fries a little less crunchy so if you like crunchy fries they probably aren't for you.
Nice they have all the condiments just available for you to grab without asking.
Went on a sunday after a walk a the park.
Ordered French fries, sweet potato fries and a cheese hotdogs üå≠ We were served super fast.
The fries could be better if fried longer.
The hot dog is basic.
The cashier they had in the evening around 7 pm on 11/11  was rude, acted careless, and not interested in taking our order.
We asked if they had fresh lemonade and followed to serve us lemonade without asking him to.
The place looks really nice.
It just needs better staff  ASAP
Went there during enjoying a music concert in Discovery Green.
We ordered french fries and cheese nachos.
The food was served very fast and hot.
The food was okay.
The price here is low.
the restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating.
The indoors are well air-conditioned which is a big relief for a hot summer day.
4/26/2019 - 4:45pm - It was my very 1st time I visited this establishment & I was very impress on how amazing this place is & how clean it was also & how polite the staff are..
I had ordered the Beef Fajita Tacos & a Chili Cheese Dog for my father (2 soft drinks) came to a total of $15  I was very impressed with the taste of the food & do highly recommend this place either before going to a Baseball or basketball game or any other activity you may have..  Great prices, wonderful atmosphere & worth trying something different or new..
The food was absolutely fantastic!
I was afraid that the sauce on the chicken would be too hot, but it was just perfect.
This was easily one of the best meals that I‚Äôve had in a while.
Our waiter was extremely kind, but we didn‚Äôt see him much.
We always had what we needed, however, by asking the other wait staff as they passed by.
It was a busy time of day, so parking was a bit of a challenge.
We parked a couple of blocks away, but the weather was beautiful so we didn‚Äôt mind walking.
I LOVED the food and will definitely be back!
Super great wings!
I'm usually a dry rub fan, so hesitated when the waitress recommended these.
But they blew me away.
Fall off the bone tender.
The breading was crispy and delicious!
The sauce had a little bite to it, but not too much.
A bit of Asian flavor that was perfect.
It uas a very mild cream sauce that was good too.
We were only there for an appetizer this time, but I look forward to having more of their food next time.
Also, the prices were reasonable...
Thank you for that!
Fancy place but food was just ok for it being in a premier downtown destination.
Black bean soup was absolutely the best thing there and the waffles were amazing as well.
Other food was just ok to me.
The mix drinks were very good.
Lots of bums in the streets all around the parking areas though.
That wasn‚Äôt pleasant at all but not the restaurants fault.
Overall 6.5/10
We loved the food here!
We checked out this place while we were looking for something to eat for dinner.
Loved the pulled pork tacos, the delicious butter cake desert, and refreshing drinks!
Place was an easy walking distance from the main area too.
The staff and atmosphere was also excellent!
Plenty of free for all seating indoors and outdoors as well.
A must try!
The husband and I decided to come here last night and we are so glad we did!
When you walk you, there's a sign telling you to seat yourself, so we did.
I do not recall our server's name, but we had a couple of different people stop by while we were there and they were all so helpful!
For starters, I ordered the Southern Old Fashioned, it was really good and just what I needed to warm my innards on a chilly night.
Husband got the Midnight Mule, and he commented how good it was and it really gave him a buzz (maybe because it was strong, maybe because he hadn't eaten since breakfast, or maybe both?).
We were going to get appy's, but our server did state they are all large portions, so we skipped it sine it was just the two of us.
For my entree, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken.
It was so tasty with fresh veggies, goat cheese and a terrific lemon butter sauce.
Husband ordered the chicken blackened fettuccine and he really enjoyed it, although he felt it needed 4 pieces of garlic bread, not 2.
He did request more and our server gladly obliged.
Our entrees came out super fast, which was awesome!
We did also get the banana pudding for dessert, which was really tasty but a bit difficult to get out of the big mason jar.
Overall, this was a great meal and we are looking forward to coming back.
Crowded fast food chain.
Can order from their sleek terminals and email the receipt to you.
I personally like their size of burger (small) and yet tasty.
Toilet door has numbered lock, as for it's code from the counter.
The food here is very tasty and they have good vegetarian options for my son.
My biggest issue with this place is there is no adjacent parking.
Also order your burger well done or it will still be pink inside.
We walked by this place twice taking a stroll downtown and we decided to go ahead and give it a try.
Friendly staff very well priced will definitely come again try the spicy hamburger.
Quality food
Came here for lunch with my husband and son.
The staff was very friendly and tentative.
They gave my son a treat while we waited to order.
The food was not so great it reminds me of school cafeteria food.
I got the chicken sandwich with bacon and Alvacado my husband got the bacon burger.
The bacon was almost like the pre cooked bacon u can buy off the shelf at the store.
I will say that their custard and shakes are amazing ‚ù§.The cheese fries weren't bad just lacking flavor.
We spent about $65 for just us 3 and it wasn't worth the price to me for the quality.
Too crowded when we entered into the restaurant they were friendly asked you to not use he kiosk so unfortunately we had to wait in line.
Upon ordering they do not tell you the burgers are plain and do not come with anything on them they explained that they have a bar of fixings which in fact was not true and the burgers are tremendously small‚Ä¶.. new to Houston and people ranted and raved about this spot but we ended up at a nice burger spot down the way in Finn Hall by the name o Craft Burger!
The burgers there are homemade traditional and very good, try them instead!
Flavor: C Service: B Tea: A Solo dining: B If you‚Äôre downtown near the convention center and need a quick and decent lunch, this place will do.
But nothing impressed me.
I got the blackened redfish BLT and I thought it was dry and lacked flavor.
The bread and butter appetizer was also unimpressive - not piping hot or unique.
Our experience was excellent, we had a nice window seat and the restaurant was open and airy.
We ordered the summer Burratta with focaccia bread and it was very refreshing.
Very enjoyable with an amazing vinaigrette dressing.
The steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.
We loved the fact that the oysters were large and full of flavor.
Stir fry shrimp had the perfect level of spice it doesn‚Äôt come too spicy but you can always add more.
The restaurant was kind enough to send us a slice of cake for our anniversary as well.
I also have nothing but good things to say about our waiter, Rick.
Thanks for your suggestions and taking the time to explain pairings with us.
Appetizer was the bread and blue crab corn fritters.
The fritters were tasty.
Nice outside.
Excellent chunks of crab.
I liked the sauce for them as well.
The kale salad and red fish was great.
The fish was cooked perfectly.
The fried potatoes salad was a surprise hit.
I‚Äôve never seen that item on a menu.
My friend got the wedge salad.
She loveddd it.
Service was amazing as well.
Definitely want to go back!
Hit up The Grove right by Discovery Green for some seriously tasty eats.
Heads up, though ‚Äì the bar service might test your patience.
But with the cool vibe and eclectic mix of folks stopping by, you won‚Äôt mind the wait.
It's a hot spot for out-of-towners too, thanks to its prime spot.
Came here to eat for dinner.
Found the staff to be really awesome!
Cesile was outstanding!
Super attentive and made great recommendations!
We started with the Bread and Berrata, the blue crab fritters, and the beet salad!
All were tasty and delicious!
The real treat though was the filet mignon!
Holy smokes!
We were not expecting that.
Compliments to the chef.
It was cooked to perfection and the flavor was absolutely amazing.
My wife said it is the best steak she‚Äôs ever had.
We finished the meal with espresso and the berries and cream.
Perfection!
We will be back!
The atmosphere, service, and drinks were great.
The seating and my food are not so great.
I like to talk to everyone at the table, but because it was 8 or 10 of us we were seated at a long table, but we were all seated on the same side of the table so you only got to talk to the person the left or right of you .
The food had pepper everywhere.
My little salad on my plate had so much pepper in it that it wasn't edible.
I ordered a side of 4 shrimp for $12.
I didn't mind the price.
I just thought they were going to be a nice size they were not, and they also had a lot of pepper on them.
The chedder biscuits were hard, and not like a biscuit at all, we had to leave that behind.
The best part of my meal was the stone ground grits they were to peppery, but I had to eat something.
The lemon drop made my day.
The ambience was very elegant and refined.
Our servicer Tyrone knew the menu and was very knowledgeable with his recommendation.
His drink recommendation was excellent.
And Chris was the Cherry on top.
He made sure our area was clean and sufficient.
Thank you  for your cation to customer service!...I will be back...from the Chi!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The ambiance is nice & it's a cool vibe.
Champagne is provided while waiting for your table.
The staff is nice.
The specialty cocktails are good.
The food is OK.
Food, services was social media worthy.
Rooftop party on a Thursday night if that‚Äôs what you are looking for.
We had an awesome experience.
Parking was a bit of a headache.
Great date night..the staff was very attentive and the mood is set once you enter you are met with a glass of champagne and nice music.
The waitress we had was very nice and friendly.
The person who sat us could‚Äôve been more professional but she tried seating us way in the bush bungalow and nobody sits ‚ÄúBaby in the Corner ‚Äúso I requested a better view and she was irritated but did move us.
The drinks were good and will sneak up on you sip sllooowww.
The food was delicious and it‚Äôs a la carte ,,Be advised there is a service charge add on to your bill and it‚Äôs not gratuity.
Hands down best burger I had in Houston.
Recommend the standard hamburger.
Also the crawfish hash was delicious!
Truly Houstonian specialty.
I loved the space - bar, some tables inside and huge patio/garden with a love DJ.
Awesome atmosphere for a good-weather lunch!
BB Lemon in Midtown Houston is a culinary gem for its incredible smash burgers paired with a selection of Texas craft beers.
The attentive staff adds to the dining experience, guiding me and my girlfriend through the menu with enthusiasm.
The vibrant atmosphere and the delectable combination of smash burgers and local brews make BB Lemon a must-visit spot for those seeking a delightful blend of flavors and excellent service in the heart of Midtown Houston.
It might look closed but it is open.
Doing the Dave Portnoy rating 1 to 10 scale we gave it an easy 8.8 and we'll go to again.
Parking can be limited and an issue
Unfortunately, this place is extremely underwhelming.
Nothing on the menu is worth the high prices.
There is limited indoor seating, but the seating options are comfortable.
The entire layout, including the entrance, is not wheelchair friendly, though.
It is definitely recommended that you make a reservation should you choose to come here.
The chicken lollipop appetizer did not have a good fry on them, so the sauce was the only flavorful part.
The ceasar salad appetizer is a very small portion with far too much dressing added.
The meat of the burgers had minimal flavor, and the cheese placed on them is the cheap oil based kind.
The buns that the burgers were placed on were so thin and floppy that it was nearly impossible to keep everything together to eat.
The fries are just thick freezer fries with a hefty amount of salt thrown on top.
The cheesecake is the same kind you can get from a deli franchise.
The only things we enjoyed were the brownie and the lemonade (which is made with Meyer lemons).
Despite the subpar food, I did appreciate the kind staff.
We came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.
I started with the Bacon Parmesan.
It was like a chicken parmesan with a distinct porkiness.
It didn't taste like bacon to me though.
I follow that with the Fried Chicken Sandwich.
This is a tasty sandwich.
I enjoyed it because fried chicken is my favorite.
I had to end the meal with a cheesecake.
This cheesecake was creamy and tasty.
The blueberry sauce drizzled over the top was fantastic.
The restaurant has a full bar.
I had hoped to sit outside, but it was too hot to be comfortable.
A step up from the casual diner, and the food/service were fantastic.
Valet works on tips, so don‚Äôt forget to bring cash.
The patio is the place to be!
I come a good 3/4 times a week.
Every server is great however Josue gave me the best service during Happy Hour.
It‚Äôs servers like this that make you keep coming back.
S/O to him!
Food was amazing, first time coming and had an amazing experience.
Tiffany‚Äôs service was top notch def recommend seating with her.
Got the Crab Nachos and the Chicken Fajitasüî•üî•üî•üî•.
Sad I had to watch the Ravens lose though.
Stopped in and grabbed a couple of drinks and dinner at the bar.
The bartender was friendly and attentive.
I ordered the spicy salmon with brussel sprouts and rice with charro beans.
The salmon wasn't spicy, but had a great flavor with the mango sauce.
The beans were actually the star of the show, I don't usually eat beans, but these were so flavorful.
Great place to stop in and the prices are reasonable and portions large.
Food is hood and prepared fresh.
I enjoyed the empanadas, cheese enchiladas, rice and beans.
The crab nachos lacked crab meat this time but I still like them.
Delicious chips, guacamole and salsa.
Service is excellent!
Adult drinks fantastic!
Brussels sprouts and fajitas were delicious too!
The food and service were excellent.
Rubi was our server and she was fast and attentive.
We made it in for happy hour and tried the house margaritas and they were excellent!
The ceviche was so good and fresh.
The queso with taco meat had amazing flavor.
We couldn't decide on what to get so we tried the botany and the brisket empanadas were so yummy and full of flavor.
Can't wait to eat here again!
Very pretty restaurant with great service.
I was disappointed with the portions.
But it is more of a fancy restaurant.
I believe this steak was 8oz.
If that gives you an idea.
It tasted good while it lasted.
Phenomenal experience.
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was perfection.
Great menu, great service (thank you, Joseph!!
), food to die for, all in an upscale modern ambiance.
Will definitely be coming back.
p.s.
- may just be the best Lobster Bisque in town!
!
A nice experience in downtown Houston We were seated immediately and were attended to by the server equally fast the.
The food absolutely marvellous.
Highly recommend this place for great food and overall experience.
One of the best restaurants in Houston.
This is my first time eating at the current location.
Tremendous amount of offerings on the menu.
The steaks were absolutely incredible.
Best of the best.
I came for a Friday lunch and the experience was distasteful.
I expected for a place of this caliber to have workers on staff to greet, bartend and wait tables.
There was ONE guy who was bartending and when a group walks in he leaves to start waiting tables skipping what I asked for at the time.
I left before I finished the entire meal and skipped the dessert.
I walked into a empty establishment and now I understand the reason for this desert establishment.
If you don't want to hire anyone just close the place up.
Now the food, it was decent, room for improvement but the price isn't worth the dining experience.
Guadalajara stack was exceptional, I highly recommend it.
The tacos al pastor were also really great.
The charro beans were a little lacking in flavor.
Excellent service.
We came here before a concert at the House of Blues.
The close proximity to that event center made this restaurant very convenient.
Very good.
Ate here before Eagles concert.
Crowded but service was prompt and food came out after not long a wait.
House margaritas were delicious.
Recommend.
This place caught my eye because of the look of the exterior.
It looked like an upscale restaurant and then we saw that the price was not bad at all.
There‚Äôs public parking all around but we didn‚Äôt have to worry about that because we‚Äôre staying here downtown.
The ambiance is really beautiful.
It‚Äôs colorful and definitely has that Latin vibe.
The restaurant is huge.
There are seatings on the first and second floor.
The time we came in there was no wait, we were seated right away.
Our server Guillermo was very nice.
So polite and friendly.
He had a great smile each time he came to us.
The food came right away.
My friend had the Enchilada Marisco and I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes with Shrimp and Lump Crab.
We tasted each others food.
I think I liked my friends order better :).
That lump crab over the enchilada was very good.
I liked my food but I think there was too much going on with it.
I would eat the sweet corn cake by itself not with all the toppings.
The toppings were very tasty but not with the Corn Cake.
And I didn‚Äôt taste any Crab.
And you can never go wrong with chips and salsa.
I definitely recommend the Enchilada Marisco!
Had a great lunch here.
Guacamole was on point.
Liked the jalapeno beef enchiladas.
Service was really good.
Never disappoints.
We love coming here before the baseball game, basketball game or concert at Toyota Center.
The food is excellent and so are the drinks.
The staff is great and the atmosphere is inviting.
I recommend them.
The food was amazing.
This restaurant  really recommends.
I and my fiance had our engagement dinner here.
The restaurant was nice enough to decorate the table.
Also, on Valentine's Day, they had live singer's which was awesome.
They singers also give us a surprise shout-out on our engagement, which was cool.
We will definitely be back.
All times listed below are from the moment we were seated at the table.
Our server was Travis.
Drink order taken: 66 seconds  Drink arrival: two minutes thirty four seconds.
(2:34)  Order taken: two minutes forty six seconds (2:46)  Bread Arrived three minutes fourth four seconds (3:44)  Salads arrived seven minutes fify four seconds (7:54)  Main course arrived to table at twelve minutes two seconds  Received check to the table at twenty eight minutes sixteen seconds (28:16)  Food was dead in and exactly as ordered.
I ordered Manicotti with sausage.
The sausage was a generous amount and separate from the Manicotti.
The Manicotti tasted fresh and texture was perfect to the pallet.
My wife ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was served at the perfect temperature.
The sauce was really creamy and smooth.
Prices were moderate and acceptable.
In the heart of the theater district - Experience the ambiance, savor fresh delights, and enjoy a succulent meal!
I highly recommend this downtown gem, my 1st visit from Alaska and I will be back ‚úîÔ∏è  Add this to your must eats in downtown Houston!
I love the vibe in this restaurant - the classy vibe with a relaxed atmosphere.
The food was incredible!
I had pasta poretti.
We also ordered spaghetti and meatballs, chicken alfredo and pollo poretti.
They were all AMAZING!!!!
I highly recommend this restaurant!
Ask for Martin - he‚Äôs an awesome waiter!
First time here and had an amazing dining experience!
My waiter took great care of me Monday night and gave me some solid wine recommendations.
Took his word for a pasta dish and I can‚Äôt wait to return to try more!
Highly recommended and the live music on Mondays really seals the deal.
Very delicious food, recommended
Popular durring events at the toyota center
Work there and also Carrie Underwood was there
This place was outstanding.
We had to wait a little while, but it was well worth the wait.
It‚Äôs conveniently located near Jones Hall so you can dine, experience  a  New Orleans meal before catching your show.
Went here for 2 reasons gumbo and poboy.
I also added the bbq shrimp.
Gumbo was not good in my opinion.
Tasteless and very greasy.
The poboy was ok.
The catfish was fried but it was gritty I'm assuming from the fish fry.
I would say go check them out for yourself.
BTW the location I tried was downtown Houston.
I ordered the boudin egg rolls and shrimp po buy and gumbo to go!
All of it was delicious and the owner, Monica is sweet as pie!
I recommend you come if you want the real deal!
Your taste buds will be in heaven!
No need to make that 6-hour drive to NOLA when you can get the same great taste in downtown Houston.
The shrimp will smack in whatever you order.
And my wife swears the yakamein is life-changing.
During our visit we got TOP TIER customer service from the head chef & owner, Mrs. Monica Landry.
Always great to see a black-owned business thriving üôåüèΩ  Tip: this spot is located inside of Lyric Market, an upscale food court, so you‚Äôre surrounded by all sorts of cuisine you can try out to pair with 1929‚Äôs deliciousness.
Remember to get your garage parking validated!
Inside the Lyric Market.
Absolutely delicious.
My daughter got the grilled shrimp poboy, and it was terrific.
The red beans were my fav.
Reasonably priced for the portion, freshness, and quality.
I‚Äôd go back.
They‚Äôll validate your parking for free if you‚Äôre under 2 hours and bring a receipt from one of the vendors in the market.
Nice deli and market place.
There is a restaurant attached to it but there is a nice casual dining area in the deli area.
Good meals and very reasonable prices with big portions!
Brussel sprouts and hand made chips with the half rotisserie chicken was delicious!
Nice little market with a range of different goods from food, sauces, oils and even bath and soap items.
This is my favorite place to catch brunch downtown on a Sunday.
I like coming to visit with friends or grabbing a table by myself to work.
The food is always delicious and Bryan was so friendly and helpful, he made what was already a good experience great.
Had a good brunch here.
Not too busy.
Good atmosphere.
Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
Food was as good as it looks.
I have passed by this place at night on the weekend and it's got a good vibe inside.
Really nice spot for brunch, the waitress who served us, I can't recall her name, (for management, she is the Russian girl) was amazing, she looked after us and made us feel welcome.
The Tiffany Mimosa is really nice, as was everything we ordered
We went there for my birthday brunch.
I was concerned beacuse the place was empty!
This was our first visit.
The service was prompt and our orders came out at a decent time.
I had the veggie tacos with a "Tiffany's" mimosa.
Both were very good!
I was treated with the cake, was a chocolate lovers dream!
Overall a great time.
Only drawback was the restroom, it needed attention, and the prices seemed a little steep.
I will be back though.
What a cute place.
Very appealing to the eyes.
The service was a little slower but honestly the company was great so we didn‚Äôt mind.
The steak quesadilla was delicious, chips were the 4/5
Shalanda gave great service !
!!
Very pleasant individual.
The wait to be seated was a little unorganized.
We were told a 5-10 minute wait and ended up waiting about 25 minutes.
Did not like that there was water and chips on table before being seated.
They have indoor, bar, and outdoor seating.
The quality of food was decent.
The mixture that was on top of my carne asada did not look very appetizing.
They do not have black beans which was slightly disappointing.
Experience here was just ok.
The restaurant was very warm which was not comfortable.
I think they were short on staff as service was very slow.
Food was good but not great.
Chicken enchiladas were good but cabbage salad was not great so would advise to get the rice and beans instead.
Probably with another try.
Love this place!!!
Excellent Food, great service our waiter was a gem.
üòãüíûüòã
Walked in and was greeted with smiles.
Sat at the bar top which the bartender had a very outgoing personality that made what I'm about to say with ease.
Ordered the La Vaquero tacos w/rice and let me just explain that my first expectation was low for the meal but this was absolutely delicious.
Brisket wasn't dried or bland.
Rice didn't have alot veggies in it like most restaurants which I like.
It was moist and the best restaurant made rice thus far.
We were visiting Dallas on a work trip and stopped in to eat here while walking around.
We had Juan as our server and he was professional, attentive, and sweet.
The food was delicious and I had one of the best mango margaritas I‚Äôve ever had in my life.
This stop was just on a whim.
We immediately sat at the bar and immediately greeted by our servers.
I‚Äôm sad that we won‚Äôt be back this week, Araceli is absolutely amazing.
My ‚Äúregular‚Äù margarita wasn‚Äôt regular in any way‚Äîit was beyond delicious.
It was perfect.
My friend had a passion fruit margarita‚Äîtoo sweet for me but perfect for her.
She said it was dangerous because you couldn‚Äôt taste the alcohol.
:) Amazing service.
I cannot wait to come back to Dallas.
Wonderful establishment.
Thank you so much.
Naomi was our server and she was very sweet.
The food was great and they even have a Mock-tail menu!
We had veggie enchiladas, veggie pasta, and flan for dessert.
If you're in the area for the Musems or Aquarium, this is a great spot that's smack-dab in the middle of West End.
My server Juan, was super kind, definitely recommend asking for him.
The atmosphere was so inviting.
The enchiladas are delicious, they have a spicy kick, but very good.
Juan was a stupendous host and made sure we had everything we needed.
We had the Thursday special chimichanga's and the Texas margaritas.
I had the watermelon and my spouse had the original and they were great!
The food came out very quickly and the salsa with chips was great the chips where still warm!!
The bathroom facilities were clean and well lit.
The cheese sauce and the refried beans blew us away!!
Definitely check this place out its so close to the grassy knoll and the holocaust museums
The table wasn't clean; there were food crumbs scattered on it, as well as on the seats and the floor.
Additionally, the water cups were dirty and looked unappetizing.
I'd like to mention that despite the cleanliness issue, the food was satisfactory, and the prices were reasonable.
I'd also like to highlight our server, Fenta, who provided excellent service throughout our dining experience.
I booked this venue for Valentine‚Äôs Day with my wife.
$85 per person is reasonable so I booked it.
We were greeted promptly and politely by the hostess.
The restaurant was basically empty, which made me wonder why the booking time was so limited.
It took a few minutes to be greeted and offered drinks, but the bar was busy so we understood.
When we placed our order, we watched our drinks sit on the bar for 8 minutes before my wife got up and got them for us.
When it came time to order from the fixed menu, I was concerned when they didn‚Äôt ask what temperature I wanted my filet.
Come to find out, it‚Äôs only well done.
They brought out my plate with mushrooms, some sort of potato, and a thin filet cooked WELL DONE.
It was painfully obvious the steak was premade and microwaved to order.
My wife got scallops and risotto, the scallops had a strong fishy smell to them, which is NOT in the norm.
I sent my steak back to be prepared medium rare as a filet should be.
The product they returned to me was BLUE RARE at best.
At this point, I was annoyed.
So I asked them to return the food and bring us our check.
I gladly paid for my wife‚Äôs meal since she tolerated the scallops.
The oxtail pie appetizer was bland, and the cappuccino tomato soup starter was good, but was maybe an ounce.
To top it off, they brought h wife her dessert and sent back mine since I returned my meal, and requested it to be removed (I took one bite of my well done steak).
While I understand they shouldn‚Äôt just hand stuff out, they should have at least made an effort to remedy the poor food quality.
I don‚Äôt blame the server at all.
Either way, I paid $113 for my wife‚Äôs meal that was mediocre at best.
The risotto was bland and overcooked along with the overly fishy scallops.
I hope management fixes this for future diners.
Luckily, we found an Italian place down the street to eat.
We spent over four hours having a calm and special moment at Grill & Vine.
We ordered multiple items from the menu from the beginning to  the end.
MARCO was very attentive and caring of our stay.
Team members like this really make palces memorable and make us want to come back!
Well done, excellent attention!
We had a large group and there was a nice area with canvas walls in the middle of the restaurant.
I'm gluten free and specifically asked about a bun.
I was told they had a GF bun available so I ordered a burger but it came on lettuce instead.
They brought me gelato/ice cream instead of the pecan pie bars others received since I'm gluten free.
The lemon gelato & chocolate chunk ice cream were delicious but the other flavor was not good.
Absolutely delicious.
Definitely worth every penny.
Just what we needed for wife's birthday celebration.
Campisi is situated in a busy and trendy part of downtown Dallas.
The lounge like atmosphere is inviting and comfortable.
We were a party of 3 on a busy Saturday night.
We were seated quickly and the waitstaff were initially very accommodating and helpful.
When it came time to take our order, the waiter had lost focus and was not able to remember what drinks or food orders he had put in for us.
While we did not wait long for our food, the waiter had no recollection of what we ordered and brought our 3 entrees at 3 separate times after bringing the incorrect dishes to the table twice.
After the food was delivered we were not checked on again and empty glasses not refilled.
It WAS busy, so all that could be forgiven.
What could not be forgiven was the food.
There was no discernible difference between what they distinguished as "red sauce" and "marinara".
My combo pasta plate arrived so heavily swamped in sauce that I initially could not see any pasta under the soupy mess.
The meatballs were bland.
The sauce was beyond mediocre.
The ravioli was actually gross.
I would never eat here again.
The pizza at this place is amazing!
I had pepperoni with jalape√±os.
It was hot and fresh and thin crust  (less carbs).
It is really dark on one side of the restaurant, but you can sit on the side by the street with lots of natural light.
What a horrible experience overall.
The veal Parmesan was disgusting.
It was like eating a shoe.
The meatballs had a very strange spice that I wasn‚Äôt familiar with and they were relatively cold.
I will say that the raviolis were decent and the lasagna was acceptable.
They put us at a table right near the front door when it was 107¬∞ outside.
Our waiter must‚Äôve just started.
He literally brought us our check two bites into our dinner.
I do not recommend this place at all.
Very Bizarre!
You order and pay for your food at the bar then get your drink, go fill it up and find your table.
Very odd considering they ask for a tip less than five minutes of being in the building.
I‚Äôm so surprised by the ratings being fairly good.
There is no lighting to even see what you‚Äôre eating.
The mini table lights are tinted red and serve no purpose.
Writing this from the table.
Now that I‚Äôm done with my food‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that maybe I‚Äôve had too much good food and it makes this food taste like bleh.
Too many good reviews on the food while my chicken parmigiana tasted like a dog shook bath water all over it.
I‚Äôm glad I tried it and I will never come back.
To add: my server came to my table once.
To bring my food.
I‚Äôm relieved and feel less guilty about not tipping upfront.
Should definitely be minimum wage staff since they aren‚Äôt full service.
Great location!
Awful food for the price.
Paid almost $20 for a 1 topping pizza and somehow it was cold and burned.
Absolutely delicious.
Get the mini tequenos for your side.
You will NOT regret it.
I got the pulled pork and buffalo chicken empandas and they were amazing.
I also tried the plantains and they're also very good.
It's so nice to see a place that doesn't just use the sides as a throw away.
Delicious empanadas served fast!
We tried the chicken, chimichurri, and roasted veggies and all of them were incredible!
Small and not too speedy, but the results were delicious.
Chimichurri salsa is stinky and garlicy and wonderful.
Al pastor empanadas had just enough caramelized pineapple to give complexity but not over sweetness.
Like a well done ravioli.
Atmosphere is perfect.
Great music, a good variety of seating options.
Love the art on the walls, everything was on point.
Now onto the food, that I can easily say was some of my favorite empanadas I‚Äôve ever had.
I got the beef chimichurri and Al pastor and both were phenomenal.
No hesitation to come back here
I was visiting Dallas for a concert at House of Blues.
So I wanted to find a place nearby to eat.
Unfortunately, the street parking infront of the cookhouse, I think is 9am-4pm.
I got there around 5:30pm.
I'm not familiar with Dallas and parking.
Luckily I had a parking pass for House of Blues and it was just a 6 min walk to the Cookhouse.
I got 2 empanadas with salsa Verde, sweet tea, and sweet plantains.
Pork Al Pastor and Beef & Potato.
They were freshly cooked and so delicious.
üòã My boyfriend came with me and even asked for an extra order of plantains, they were so good.
The place is very clean and aesthetically pleasing.
Loved all the sitting options.
The people who were working, were so kind.
We didn't realize they closed at 6 at around 5 mins after we asked what time they closed.
They didn't say anything because they wanted us to enjoy our food.
I would've totally gotten out before.
Surprised they weren't packed with their customer service and food.
Will definitely come back every time I visit Dallas!
I had high expectations after reading the amazing reviews, but I was disappointed by the food, which didn't justify the 45-minute drive.
The shrimp and grits were just okay in terms of flavor, while the pimento cheese had a good taste.
The Ella‚Äôs punch drink resembled a mimosa with a slightly stronger flavor.
However our service was amazing  but I won‚Äôt be returning again.
Warm, friendly atmosphere, off the beaten path, recommended to us by a chef at a different restaurant.
Breakfast and lunch are available.
We had a short wait for a late breakfast.
Good strong coffee and a special coffee.
Enjoyed Joe's balls Sampler.
The crab ones were our favorite, and Ellen's should bottle the sauce that accompanied them, excellent.
Pancakes were fluffy and not sweet, and I loved the soft, whipped butter.
French toast was cooked the way we like it.
Crisp on the outside, moist in.
Biscuits and gravy were good.
I would have liked more sausage.
Home fries are good.
We wanted the pancake pot pie, but they were out, we were told they sell out fast.
We will definitely try again if we're ever in the area.
It was worth the wait.
Great breakfast options, both American, Mexican and Tex Mex.
The portions are very well served, the waitress was very friendly and the price is right.
The pork chop and the chili were great.
Very much recommended!
Absolutely loved the blackened catfish with the green beans!
The fish was succulent and the green beans nice and sweet and perfectly cooked.
It was perfect.
We also ordered the brisket sandwich which was also delicious!
We will be back for sure!
Got there around 11AM and didn‚Äôt get seated until 12AM during a Friday.
It‚Äôs understandable since it‚Äôs lunch hour!
Not going to complain about the wait.
Our service and waitress did an amazing job.
We also wanted to thank the cleaning crew too.
Everyone was friendly.
First off, I ordered an iced chai latte.
The drink is huge, so I recommend ordering it if you‚Äôre super hungry that day.
I had to take my drink to-go after we left.
The drink was delicious.
I recommend this drink.
I also ordered the pancake pot pie.
Our waitress recommended I try it.
Apparently, it has been featured on Food Network.
The pot pie wasn‚Äôt that good even though I‚Äôm a sweet and savory type.
Our waitress also gave us tips on how to eat it with small amounts of syrup since it‚Äôs also mushy in the bottom layer.
I would likely come back to try another meal.
This one just wasn‚Äôt it for me.
We came on a Tuesday, and I would highly recommend.
Great deals on the margaritas, service by Ashley was great and drinks were always full, strong and tasty.
We started with the shrimp ceviche which was was delicious.
Would come back just for that.
Then we had the shrimp tacos, pastor and fish tacos as well.
Shrimp and pastor for the win there.
Would make a point to stop by again.
This place was delicious and the service was so great!
The table stayed bussed, the drinks were delicious (and we came during wild hour so they were a great price), and the food was all so good!
David W was our server and he was so nice and knowledgeable!
He gave us all the hot tips on the menu and helped make the dining experience a wonderful one.
Plus, they had great music!
We will definitely be coming back.
Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever tasted!
The flavors were exceptional, and every dish was a delight to the taste buds.
We ordered the lamb shank, chicken taquitos, chicken fajitas and flan!
What truly elevated the experience was our host, David.
He was not only delightful but also incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.
He took exceptional care of us, explaining each dish with enthusiasm and ensuring a fantastic dining experience.
Kudos to David and the team for their exceptional food and service!
Can't wait to visit again.
Our server was Kenzie!
Great service.
Really great food and drinks.
First time trying this place and the food was delicious!
You can tell they use great quality.
Loved the steak fajitas and it‚Äôs hard to find a good place that makes them high quality for the price.
They make them fresh to order and you choose how to cook it.
Downtown does not have much good food places but this one is worth it.
We will for sure come back.
So thrilled to have Wild Salsa reopening in downtown Dallas!
The design of the interiors has a sleek funky with a retro touch vibe ‚Äî a hospitable atmosphere.
The margaritas fixed by Emily were flawlessly excellent and the perfect companion for the deliciously fresh green salsa and nachos.
We had the veggies enchiladas and the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice on the side which all hit the right spot.
Both wildly tasty and tasteful in presentation and portion size.
Just perfect!
Not to mention the lovely and informative discussion with David who detailed us the concept and future events and programs of this delightful gastronomic locale.
A very pleasant and highly-recommended experience!
The food was amazing.
It was a perfectly lit restaurant for a nice romantic dinner.
Our server had a wonderful personality and made our vist fun.
When you come in you get greeted properly and when you leave they open the door.
Very lovely evening.
Ravenna is a charming little restaurant with great ambiance, food, and service.
My husband had the chicken parmesan and carrot cake.
I had the pecan crusted salmon and cheesecake.
Everything was fresh and delicious.
Portion sizes were on point.
I also had their raspberry tea.
Robert was an amazing server.
He was very attentive.
I highly recommend this restaurant when you're in Dallas.
I visit Dallas every summer.
Last year & this year we had the same waiter.
He made us so excited to come back so we are making it a tradition!
Last year he treated us like queens and he even remembered us this year.
I‚Äôm pregnant so I couldn‚Äôt drink wine (I love your selection!)
but Steven (the waiter) brought me out a mocktail so I could fit in with my girls.
He also asked when I was due & surprised me with a tiramisu cake with the MOST beautiful chocolate artwork!
He took the time to see how far along I was & make me feel so special.
I just wanted to let his manager/owner know that he is THE heart & exhibit of why we love Ravenna & will keep coming back ‚Äî oh and the food is SO DELICIOUS too!
Steven I hope you see this!
You have a heart like no other & can make EVERY single person you see feel welcomed and known.
I hope we get you as our waiter next year!
Love, the Nebraska girl!
We had an exceptional dinner.
Stephen took care of us from beginning to end.
It was a fairytale dinner.
From helping with our wine selections, paying extra close attention to our toddler‚Äôs needs (wet napkins to help clean up vodka sauce), helping with the menu, perfect attentiveness, and even a beautiful Christmas song sung to us at our table, we were in disbelief at our picturesque evening.
The food is amazing, the service is top notch, and you will enjoy the Italian ambiance.
Thank you to everyone who made our night here unforgettable!
We are just finishing up a meal here and it has been beyond excellent.
From the minute we walked in super friendly and nice.
Me my wife and my 4yr old son and they paid extra attention to him and got his food and drink quickly.
Nice and interacted with him.
Very polite to me and my wife.
Food is excellent.
Waiter was 10/10.
My son gave it a 20/20 though just to reassure everyone.
Started with the hummus and it was a top 3 all time for me.
The Malabar was perfect.
Hot fresh Naan as well.
Finished with a perfect rice pudding.
Staff was super friendly and Raj took great care of us.
Definitely a must try in Dallas if you're in the area.
Definitely will be coming back.

I recently celebrated Diwali and my birthday with the family at Shiva's Bar & Grill in Dallas, which was an absolute delight!
Indian cuisine is a family favorite, and Shiva's exceeded our expectations.
The food was impeccably cooked, seasoned, and not greasy ‚Äì a rare find.
The presentation was as beautiful as the flavors, making it the best Indian dining experience we've had in quite some time.
Plus, people were so lovely and helpful‚ù§Ô∏è And with the relaxed ambience and full bar service, Shiva's Bar & Grill is a must-go Indian restaurant in Dallas; it is an excellent spot for authentic and top-notch Indian fare.
Highly recommendedüíØ We arrived early and got some photos without the crowdüôå Enjoy the photosüòâ
So delicious, new favorite Indian food place.
He gave us a sample of the new rice pudding and it was so good.
It was pricy but totally worth it for the amount of food they give you.
No fountain drinks but they do have canned sodas.
Also so good for people new to Indian food or who aren‚Äôt big on spiciness since they let you pick your own level of spice 1-10.
Very AMAZING for vegetarians.
They have a huge dedicated vegetarian section and I really love that!
From Denver CO , Really loved the Tortas here ‚Ä¶.
Alcohol drinks outstanding and overall great experience, very good atmosphere and service would recommend coming here ‚ù§Ô∏è
A clean and spacious Mexican restaurant.
Tacos are reasonably priced and taste well.
This is the first time I see shredded cabbage on tacos but it turns out that they work well with tacos.
Happy hour gives me a discounted beer and free chips with salsa.
That salsa has a nice kick, those who love spicy food would enjoy it.
After I ordered, they will bring food to my table.
There are four different sauces at your own service.
Maybe this is the reason that tipping is not necessary here.
The only trouble is that when their employees have a turnover, around 6 pm, they seem to have a break with food in the dinning area which is shared with customers, which is fine; but several of them were watching videos with extreme loud volume.
This is a cool place!
Reminds me of a 50s diner done in a taco shop.
I got the Al Pastor tacos and added cheese and avocado.
I used their 2nd hottest salsa and BAM those tacos were DELICIOUS!
ü§§ü§§ü§§ I got a Mexican Coca-Cola to wash it down and couldn't have been happier with it!
The staff were all very friendly and the food came out quickly.
This place is a gem!
Food was delicious; service was alright.
Still gave them a 5.
From out of town and saw they had amazing reviews and decided we would come here.
Food is ridiculously good!
The barbacoa just fell apart and melts in your mouth.
So so good!
Wow!
Amazing restaurant perfect for a girls night out!
Celebrating National Wheelchair Day, March 1st.
Loved the food and the atmosphere of this restaurant.
We had a great time.
When you visit Chet‚Äôs tryout their Mac n Cheese so good!
We had Angel very attentive and friendly making sure we had the best experience and even took the time to take our group photos!
The place is wheelchair accessible there is a lift and ramp for your convenience Definitely going back!
WOW!
What amazing service and food!
Craig was wonderful at helping me coordinate my group reservation and making sure we had the best quality of service!
Highly recommend bringing your group here if you're looking for a restaurant that accommodates.
The food really gave our group a taste of Dallas and the Mac and cheese was out of this world!
10/10 recommend!
In town for overnight first time Dallas fun, exploring with wife of 34 yrs.
We passed up many places to stop and wet our whistles as we strolled the area.
Thank goodness we did because we got lucky!
We found Chets for a few short adult refreshments.
Great, warm staff.
Inviting, calm atmosphere.
We will be back ‚Äúright here‚Äù once we return.
And, with friends.
This place is simply awesome.
Do stop in and try the strawberry margaritas.
We will review food next when we have more time.
Im sure it‚Äôs fabulous considering the smiles of everyone coming in and out of the dining areas.
Salite!
We are visiting from Florida and were in search of a great lunch spot.
We couldn‚Äôt have been more lucky when we landed at Chet‚Äôs.
The atmosphere was eclectic, yet cozy.
Our server, Alexis, was incredible!
She was extremely attentive and very helpful.
The food was delicious and came out pretty quickly!
If you‚Äôre looking for a great spot to eat, Chet‚Äôs is the place!
This was such a wonderful experience.
This place has a great Irish speakeasy vibe to it.
Decorated nicely with deep wood tones and oversized plush interior.
This place is not only Instagram worthy but the bartenders make amazing drinks.
Well balanced for all the notes within the beverage you chose, nothing over powering the other.
It was such a vibe and if your into Gin get the Gimlet with Empress GIN you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
The restroom for women was phenomenal clean and offering free items if you need ladies.
Everyone go check this cute place out.
I just stopped in at this Thai place.
It's order at the window, then pay and asks would you like to add gratuity.
I look at it and it was like was is this $3 more expensive before tip.
Oh, it's because they automatically add 15% gratuity onto to EVERY meal, then ask for an additional tip.
This is not a full service restaurant.
It's even on a disposable plate!
This is whata vegan $20 dish looks like.
Bad business practices and the noodles were overcooked.
FOOD IG: @northtx.gemz üçíWHAT THEY‚ÄôRE KNOWN FOR: a hidden gem I found out through @eatwithalysa!
A quick bite to have when walking around the Dallas Farmers Market.
üçíWHAT I ORDERED: ‚Ä¢ Tom Kha Gai (Chicken Coconut Soup) ‚Ä¢ Knom Jeeb (Pork & Shrimp Dumplings) üçí PRICE: $21.11 + $3 tip üçí THE VIBE: casual open seating.
Very clean which is something I definitely account for because I know it‚Äôs a lot of effort to keep a restaurant clean.
üçí WOULD I COME BACK?
Yes.
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Overall Rating: 10/10 - Definitely a solid and delicious Thai food place that you can just pop in at any time and grab a quick bite.
One of the first things I noticed is that the restaurant was very organized and tidy, including the restroom!
- I‚Äôve never had these two Thai dishes but wanted to try them and I was pleasantly surprised.
The dumplings were scrumptious and I believe had water chestnuts so they had a slight crunch but the meat was the right amount of chewiness and the soy garlic sauce on the bottom of the dumplings was so flavorful.
- The coconut soup was amazing!!!!
Not sweet at all and the coconut flavor was very subtle.
I asked for a side of rice it usually doesn‚Äôt come with it but honestly the soup would‚Äôve been even better without the rice because it takes away from the depth of flavor.
- I believe at this Thai restaurant you just adjust the spice level to your liking because there were 3 types of spice on each table you could add to your dishes.
I decided to add some chili paste/oil and flakes to each of the dishes and it was perfect!
- Both of these dishes were made really well and felt like a warm hug eating them.
You can tell this place pays attention to their food!
The food was so good I came here twice in one weekend!!!
My niece had been eyeing this place for awhile and I'm so glad she chose this place for her birthday dinner.
I got the crab fried rice which comes spicy.
The crab was perfectly cooked and the rice was amazing.
They top it with scrambled eggs.
I paired it with a glass of red wine.
They have white wine and beer as well.
My niece got the shrimp pad Thai and it was also really good!!
She had the purple tea which was a little too sweet for me but she liked it.
The second time I came I ordered the crab fried rice again (creature of habit here ).
But I also got the dumplings which were delicious!!!
You order at the front then get seated.
It's a small location in the middle of downtown dallas near the farmers market.
Very cute indoor seating.
They have patio seating as well.
Free parking is available in a nearby parking garage because who likes to actually park in downtown dallas.
Not me!
Will definitely hit this place up again!!
!
A small location, but the atmosphere was very calm and mellow while the food was delicious to the final bite.
If you happen to find this place, grab a seat and enjoy.
This is a cute, small, and cozy restaurant located near The Farmer's Market and close to Downtown Dallas.
They have plenty of indoor seating and a nice patio area.
The menu prices are reasonable.
We were greeted by Yuyee and she also suggested several menu items.
I suggest you ask about the spice level when ordering.
She allowed us to sample the teas they offer.
I really liked the vibe here and I'm glad I finally stopped in to try it.
We also bought a couple of Thai snacks.
I will definetly be coming back again.
üòã  Fri 02/10/2023- Came back and we were immediately greeted by Yuyeeüòä She talked with us a bit and she said this is a family owned business and they stay pretty busy on the weekends.
I tried the Pad Thai and Yuyee asked Kim if she was ordering the same dish.
I was surprised that she remembered us and our order from our last visit.
That's awesome!
Lunch was delish and the portions were more than enough.
Great Experience!
I recommend you stop by and try it.üëçüëç
Second time eating here and it was just as good at the 1st time.
I got the Mongolian beef with tofu, a spring roll and fried dumplings.
The Mongolian was good.
Meat was really tender and tofu was perfect.
Very good portion size.
The dumplings were also good.
Only thing I didnt like was the spring roll which was really good the 1st time I ate here.
Will order again though because I know it could have just been an off day.
I also dined in and the area was clean.
Great place for lunch
A Disappointing and Unkempt Dining Experience in Downtown Dallas  During a recent visit to Asia Wok, a Chinese restaurant located in the Bank of America building in downtown Dallas, I encountered several issues that left me feeling unsatisfied and disappointed with my dining experience.
Upon entering the establishment, I immediately noticed that the general area and surroundings appeared dirty and unkempt.
This lack of cleanliness and attention to hygiene further diminished the restaurant's appeal as a suitable lunch destination.
I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and to my dismay, I discovered a hard piece of chicken and what appeared to be a bone within the dish.
This oversight not only detracted from the overall quality of the meal but also raised concerns about the restaurant's food preparation standards and attention to detail.
Furthermore, the food was disappointingly subpar, lacking the exquisite flavors and textures one would expect from a Chinese restaurant.
Additionally, the pricing seemed unreasonable, with a side of lo mein and General Tso's chicken totaling $21.00.
In light of these shortcomings, I cannot recommend Asia Wok as a suitable dining option for those seeking an enjoyable and clean Chinese culinary experience in downtown Dallas.
The combination of substandard food quality, overpricing, the unfortunate presence of a bone in the chicken dish, and the uncleanliness of the premises leaves much to be desired.
Omg they are always closed when I get off.
I finally had a chance to try them Monday it was so good.
I wish it was 1 in Arlington.
I almost want to take that drive today to get some and I'm off lol
One of my go-to lunch restaurants for years.
Always fast, not too expensive for what you get, and the owner is friendly and gets to know you (I have seen him treat other regulars like he does me - namely well!).
Tucked beneath the stairs descending from the first floor of the BoA tower and a bit away from the food court there you have to go searching for it if you don‚Äôt know where it is.
Worth it!
Not a gourmet Asian restaurant, but darned tasty nonetheless.
The service is what makes this place great, Thomas really knows what he‚Äôs talking about.
The food was good and surprisingly cheap for a downtown location.
I will definitely return.
The wife and I loved this place.
What a cool little place to find in downtown Dallas!
Who knew we would find something like this while just downtown to do some business.
The food was great and the setting was so nice and quaint.
We both loved the nice, quiet atmosphere and we will for sure be back again.
We flew in from Wisconsin for a specific Chicken Fried Steak that was no longer available but the best thing on the menu said by previous Customers so I had to order a different dish with a New York strip and French fries which I‚Äôve waited almost two hours for and when I finally got it, it was mostly Fat and I‚Äôm not one to leave reviews because we had damn good experience Dakota‚Äôs Steakhouse.
Not saying we were treated poorly but the service can be way better than what we‚Äôve received.
The picture is how much fat I had on my New York strip and I‚Äôm very familiar with steak and love a nice steak dinner so I know the difference between good and bad.
Excellent, delightful food and wonderful service.
We opted for BLT Benedict and Salmon Bagel from the a-la carte menu instead of the buffet, but the buffet selection was very appealing and looked very tasty.
The decor is definitely Omni and makes you feel at home.
I'm here this week for the IAEE expo.
I came in to grab an early bite for dinner and avoid the crowds so I could get back to work.
I sat at the bar and was served by Jonathan who was incredibly engaged with me and really had great suggestions.
Although I did not have an alcoholic beverage, he was very happy to have me and he was very personal.
His suggestions were great, including dessert and I'm so glad I got to be served by him.
He is one of those individuals that loves what he does and his work and it shows.
Thanks for a great dining experience.
The salmon was spectacular and so was the Caesar salad.
John the bartender was absolutely amazing!
He crafted an amazing cocktail for my friend's birthday and he has amazing cocktail.
And not to mention his charisma.
He made the night even more special for us!
Destynee was our server and she had great charisma
I'll update this review later, but my initial impression is great.
Awesome atmosphere Good service and good food.
The prices for some of the restaurants are expensive but what do you expect it's downtown.
Got to pay to play.
Otherwise though if you can afford it.
Good food for decent prices, and the vibes are present.
Most definitely recommend.
This is my first time and I think it's a good place to taste around the world at one place .
We even  try almost Chinese, Mediterranean , Italian and some drinks and dessert üç™.
This is a great spot to stop while in Dallas if you have a group of people who all want different things to eat.
Almost like a food court with all kinds of delicious options to choose from.
I went with the Sliders and really enjoyed them the loaded tots were also delicious.
The Exchange Hall in Dallas is a very cool food hall with several different food options and a couple bars.
It's a fun place to be with good food, drinks and views of the Discovery District‚Äôs Media Wall.
I got a lobster roll at the seafood restaurant.
It's packed with lobster!üòã
We had the monkey King noodle company.
Not very good.
Noodles were mushy,  not a lot of meat, eggrolls were tiny and burnt.
Also had the lobster roll at the seafood place.
It was really tasty and had good fries.
The service at the bar was slow but decent.
Had reservations for the afternoon tea service and it was wonderful!
Just had time for a mocktail with friends late morning.
It was so nice.
Beautiful place, welcoming staff.
Who knew alcohol free cocktails could be such a pleasure?
Would love to return.
Love the place , cozy , comfortable , and you can do some shopping after your meal !

the lobster cobb is great!the olive oil cake delicious !
We had excellent service.
We went for lunch.
The lunch menu is lovely.
We tried the deviled eggs with a topping of caviar and the velvety tomato soup.
I had the escarole ceasar salad with capers, and it was excellent,  such a perfect balance of crunch and flavors.
Next, I had the pappardelle with oxtail ragu.
It was awesome, silky, and perfect.
I cannot wait to go back again.
Great atmosphere and friendly staff.
Tried the tasting menu and it was pretty good.
Getting in the restaurant is a bit awkward.
Will need to try the regular menu next time.
This little hole in the wall place is my favorite in Dallas.
They are no-nonsense, serve good food at a good price for lunch.
Had the breakfast once & it was pretty good as well.
I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu.
All of it is pretty good and very authentic family recopies converted to work in a restaurant.
Their best quality is the owner & his cheerful attitude and the salsa.
They have the absolute best rustic salsa in DFW.
Great place for a quick lunch and can sometimes have an entertaining environment right outside the window looking at the St. Paul station.
:)
Quick and pleasant service.
The breakfast burrito was delicious and affordable!
Happy to see Valentina salsa on the tables!
Been wanting to stop by & eat here but never could, until today !
I got the brisket tacos & they were so good !
I‚Äôll be back for sure!
First time eating at this restaurant.
I ordered their Lunch Special of 3 tacos of your choice with Rice & Beans with a serving of Guacamole on the side.
Good and very tasty food.
I was able too enjoy evry bite of my meal.
The employees were very nice.
I wanted tacos.
How yummy quite clean place to pick up some real Mexican food.
They had breakfast.
Who knew!
Try it out
Wonderful restaurant, wait staff sat us at the table asap, we were a group of 8.
Everyone at the table lived their meal.
Also the staff was amazing!
Everything from the drinks to dessert was good.
I had a salad with chicken it had the perfect amount of dressing on it not too much.
Bar was a pretty blue, music was not too loud.
If downtown Dallas I would suggest.
We walked from our hotel about a half a mile no issues but we were a group of 8.
They have valet parking available.
Great little spot in the West End.
The Crab cake was delicious!
We had a couple of cocktails as well that where really flavorful and refreshing.
The bar is stocked and they have infused flavored liquors as well.
The menu looked good we where just stopping by for drinks and couldn't resist the crab cake.
I would definitely come back anytime I am in the west end.
Leah was an absolutely incredible waitress.
She was kind, attentive, and gave us a lot of great tips about the menu.
The atmosphere was stunning with the thousands of Christmas lights.
It was clear a lot of work went into the ambiance.
All of Leah‚Äôs recommendations from the kitchen were phenomenal.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time here, and would gladly come back (with a strong request to be seated in Leah‚Äôs section!
).
I‚Äôve been here many times but today was a new experience.
We were sat quickly.
Our server, Nalina was swift with greeting us, recommended the beef bacon and provided excellent service.
Oh, and the DJ!!!!!
DJ GS aka Gabriel was amazing and had us on our feet.
10 out of 10 recommend!
This is definitely the place you want to be!
The drinks were great.
DJ was live.
The food was delectable.
And our server Leah was the absolute best!!
Try their brussels sprouts and they‚Äôre phenomenal.
The Quinoa Served with the best asparagus I‚Äôve tasted in my life!
I had the Salmon, while my fianc√© enjoyed his steak.
We were pleased with everything from top to bottom.
Will definitely become a regular at this venue.
Ask for Leah!
She was always there for us and gave great suggestions.
On top of that she‚Äôs beautiful and funny.
üíïüíï
Great little spot in Downtown Dallas.
Very convenient to downtown hotels off Elm/Pacific area.
Great vegetarian options.
Nice happy hour specials.
Loved my spring/summer rolls with tofu and vermicelli with tofu and salad.
Veggies were crisp and tofu had a delicious panko batter.
Friendly service and quick meal on a cold night.
Happy Hour 3-7pm Tuesday through Sunday.
Sushi rolls $1 off, same with appetizers.
Drinks are affordable too.
‚ôø Accessible with a ramp up their steps.
Thank you!
I had the beef pho.
It was good, the sizes are larger than expected.
The spicy tuna roll was good as well.
If I had any suggestions it would be to have more sprouts and herbs for the pho but I'm sure I could have asked for it!
The staff did a wonderful job especially considering it was only 2 people and they were filling up fast.
I came believing that there was a vegetarian Pho but it had been removed from the menu.
I did however try the coconut curry pho with chicken broth and it was delicious.
The spring rolls were also very good!
I ordered this grilled pork vermicelli go to and it was delicious.
The service was quick and the lady who took my order at the entrance was friendly and courteous.
I recommend this restaurant for a nice meal at a reasonable price!
The atmosphere and service was phenomenal.
The staff was friendly and the place had a very relaxing vibe for being downtown.
The food was good, but nothing that blew me away.
The portions were decent, and the prices were reasonable.
Given that it's Dallas, I would go somewhere else for Thai food before coming back here.
Sassetta was on my list for a long time and I‚Äôm happy I stopped by.
We initially got there for a late lunch but ended up doing an early dinner.
We were seated quickly and the hostess was friendly.
Sassetta is a really beautiful space and I enjoyed sitting by the window for the views of downtown.
Our server was great!
Super engaging and gave us great recommendations for wine pairings.
I ordered the gnocchi and was pleasantly surprised, it was super tasty.
Also the focaccia and olive oil was so good!
For our 1st time visit everything was great!
Cant wait to come back!
Update: We have been back several times, driving well over an hour and paying a babysitter $20 per hour, so I can get the delicious rigatoni.
The waiter last night told us that a new menu is coming in a few weeks.
Please for the love of everything don‚Äôt get rid of the rigatoni or whipped ricotta.
These items have us driving across the great state of Texas and battling the crazy Dallas roads to eat!
üíú Husband loved the chicken dish and now we‚Äôre scared it may disappear.
Everyone is friendly, but service was pretty slow, it took a very long time to get refills and check last night.
Also, It was freezing inside the restaurant as well.
We sat next to the open window and it was 76 outside and they kept offering to close the window, but it was warmer outside than inside.
Original:We went twice while staying in the Joule hotel.
Very delicious.
The burnt honey pizza sounds crazy and I‚Äôm picky, but I liked it.
The Caesar salad is really good.
Loved the whipped ricotta.
Rigatoni pasta was so flavorful and filling.
Husband loved the scallops.
The first night we went was a Wednesday and service was a little slow.
They were out of several items, but today (Friday night) they had what my husband wanted and service was much more speedy so I‚Äôm glad we gave them another try.
Saturday late evening.
Not crowded (holiday weekend) good food and service.
Great view for people watching.
Large portions.
Expected pricing for major downtown luxury hotel.
Sasetta was absolutely delicious!
We started with the tuna tartare and I had a lovely, colorful, yummy salad.
Jessica was our server and was very thoughtful and welcoming.
Great job!
Only one thing, I would encourage a gluten free pasta and crust.
I went to two other restaurants this week that had those options
I came here for my 20th birthday just hoping to get an decent experience on my solo trip to Dallas and boy was I blown away!
The staff were incredibly attentive, friendly, and kind.
The hostess especially was so hospitable and even offered to take my photo.
They gave me a name card, complimentary dessert and mocktail.
I had an amazing time and when I'm back in the area I'll be sure to stop by again.
P.S.
the rigatoni and tiramisu were delicious!
Irish food on menus not available since Covid.
Nice enough.
Kinda a sticky table  bar sort of, but expected that.
Got Sheppard‚Äôs pie it was very good.
But other items I would‚Äôve preferred.
Pls bring them back or take off menu.
20 min walk to be disappointed about online menu.
The rest of menu is American bar food.
The food was clearly not the highlight here, the Burger was pretty plain and nothing special at all.
All the ordered food tasted pretty plain and not much seasoned.
If you like your burger like this, it's a match, for me it was not.
The service was friendly and kind.
One highlight is clearly the decorations inside the pub.
There are patches of all kinds of different Rescue/Police forces from all around the world pinned to the walls.
I would not come to eat again here, just because the food did not match my expectations and for that the prize was pretty high.
This place was wonderful!
It is right across the road (diagonally) from the 9/11 memorial.
The food was fantastic.
The atmosphere was friendly.
The inside is covered in patches from first responders all over the United States and beyond.
The area is small but it is definitely worth a trip.
For just a drink or a meal!
Rightly has the reputation as the Fire-fighters pub.
Near to the 9/11 memorial and the closet fire-House to the disaster.
If your in an emergency service, bring a patch or badge and add to the collection Drink and food great
The first time I‚Äôve ever tried a Philly streak and cheese and I was not disappointed.
It‚Äôs possibly one of the tastiest things I‚Äôve ever eaten, so O‚ÄôHaras have set the bar high.
Bizarrely, the fries were terrible, but the PS&C roll gives this place a 5 star and I‚Äôll forget the rubbish fries.
The Samuel Smith IPA was also brilliant as was the cider.
The restaurant has so much character and our server Isa was brilliant.
First time returning after the pandemic, we ordered the usual dishes.
All dishes ordered were still very good; the roast duck with thin crispy skin, very little fat is the best in Chinatown.
The veggie and steamed fish were fresh and cooked just right.
The waiter was friendly.
We'll definitely return.
Not a good cantonese restaurant.
I stayed at a hotel nearby, and walking to canal street is too far.
So I searched on google and found this one.
The review is 4.2 stars which isn't that bad.
So I walked there at 7pm.
Surprisingly, I found myself to be the only dine in customer.
That should raised a red flag but I don't want to go out to search for another restaurant.
The food was mediocre at best.
I have been to a lot of cantonese restaurants all over US and Canada, and this one is certainly among the bottom ones.
No wonder no other dine in customers!
The price is cheap but you get what you paid for.
Left the restaurant unsatisfied.
Will never go back again!
A classic cash-only Chinese food restaurant.
Service was super friendly and quick (first hot dish less than 5 mins).
It was tasty and big portions.
If you need fancy - this isn‚Äôt it.
But for tasty food and a great overall NYC Chinatown experience - it is.
Came here for takeout.
Really didn't want to wait in line for 30 minutes on Christie Street.
Grabbed the three precious ingredients over rice which consisted of roast duck, roast pork and BBQ Char Siu.
The roast pork had some thick slices, but very little crispy pork skin and lean.
The BBQ Char Siu was cut thick as well with very little fat content.
The disappointment was the roast duck which was 4 slices of pretty much skin and bones.
Also came with a side of cabbage.
The most exquisite and delicious Cantonese food I have ever had in nyc Chinatown.
Service is superb attending every gastronomical needs of its clients.
Ample portion, delicately prepared and hand crafted in the kitchen.
Roast duck and other roast meat dishes are a must try!
Waiter Timmy is the best waiter I have ever come across in this part of town.
Fluent in English, Chinese and Spanish!
A must try .
You will love it Two thumbs up
The concept behind the restaurant is very very cool, and walking through the bar area into the back room you really do feel like you‚Äôre about to get locked into a vault.
There were tons of small details to give the restaurant an original bank feel, including a giant class that had shredded money in it.
The ambiance was great, the food was just fine.
We ordered the tuna and salmon tartar and hummus to start.
Neither were anything original or out of this world.
For dinner we got the wagyu burger and the duck risotto.
The burger was a regular burger, and we have another place downtown that had a better quality, lower price so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
The duck was quite nice, and the risotto had plenty of mushrooms in it, but the duck portion was a bit small compared to the risotto.
all in all the dinner was fine.
I can highly recommend this place if you want to have dinner in a special location!
The food is also really good.
The menu is not that big but perfectly fine.
Also the dishes are not super big but the taste is outstanding!
The service was perfect!
I would recommend a reservation if you want to go there with a bigger group
My banker husband wanted to eat here and we were not disappointed!
It was fantastic in all the ways!
For the price, this is a great place.
The decor is gorgeous, and the menu affordable yet high class and well-done: high-quality ingredients cooked well.
The only real criticism I have is the fries were mediocre.
Honestly, the food is awful.
Hummus was good but not mind blowing.
My husband had a burger, he said it was tasteless.
I had ravioli and was weird.
I would never come back or recommend it to anyone.
It was raining and we ran in to have a snack and keep warm.
Pizza is not the best and carbonara is not either.
I didn't like the pizza dough, the margarita was ordinary, and the 4 cheeses were very salty.
The service is excellent, the staff is pleasant.
Serving dishes for 35 minutes.
Expensive, the taste of the food is average.
I would not recommend it.
Tl:dr food was disappointing, service was decent, had to wait even though we had a reservation.
Came on a Sunday night, wasn‚Äôt too busy but we had to wait ~15 minutes even though we had a reservation.
The food took an hour to arrive, and was pretty disappointing.
Calamari and burrata were good, but the spaghetti was bland and lukewarm warm.
Tried the scampi, bolognese and some other dishes that I forgot the name of.
It wasn‚Äôt the most welcoming feeling I‚Äôve had in a restaurant before.
However the food was insane the most delicious food me & partner have ever had.
I don‚Äôt understand the reviews on here, the Penne Alla Vodka was gorgeous.
I had it again in New York twice after, but it did not taste the same and I was gutted.
Would definitely come back again.
The chips were so delicious too!!
Hats off to the chef!
I guess this place works differently with their booking process.
The place was fine, food was good, service was a little low.
It might be because Christmas time, and places are packed.
We did have reservations, and in retrospect I understand that their online booking system is making them probably lots of trouble.
Way too many double bookings on the same hour, we waited 30 minutes outside even though we had reservations (with 3 more groups of people).
The food was delicious and so was the service.
We ate outdoors and they have heating lamps.
We had the pizza and penne a la vodka with chicken.
Yummy!!!!
Oh the sangria is very good as well.
We will be back!
My fiance and I decided to grab breakfast at George's yesterday before our visit to the Statue of Liberty, and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience.
We were seated promptly upon arrival.
The diner certainly had an authentic New York City vibe, and it was bustling with locals, which added to the charm.
I opted for one of the classic egg dishes, while my fiance had the the red velvet pancakes.
Both dishes were not only fantastic value for money but also tasted delicious.
We were thoroughly satisfied with our choices.
While the potatoes served with the breakfast were something I hadn‚Äôt tried before, I would say I personally prefer the more traditional hash browns.
However, this was a minor preference, and it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of our meal.
The service was excellent, and the staff made us feel welcomed and attended to throughout our meal.
Without a doubt, the food was great, and we would highly recommend George's to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic NYC breakfast experience.
Me and my husband visited George's while on our trip to NYC.
It was super busy, we probably waited to be seated for about 25 minutes.
The waiter took a while to order our food but once he did, the food came out pretty quickly.
The breakfast was pretty good compared to some other locations we've gone through in NYC.
But outside of NYC, there are better locations, such as Cracker Barrel.
I would recommend it for the experience but in my opinion, it's just a once-and-done.
The waiters were pretty sweet though, especially for them to be super busy.
Cheap price with high standard.
Love the food as well.
Delicious and big portion brunch.
We spent 30 minutes waiting for the seat.
Always expect there will be a waiting time if you want to dine in.
A small, atmospheric place with delicious food.
the service was nice, worked efficiently and the dishes were served very quickly.
Additionally, there is a cafe inside with sweets that you can easily order to go.
Lovely place.
Food is good and so worthy for the price.
Waiters are friendly and nice.
The best pancake we had in this trip!
!
What a gem!
We had a meeting a few blocks away, found this on Google Maps, it looked interesting with Northern Italian cuisine.
Early on a Wednesday evening‚ÄîNo reservation no problem.
Great service from the staff, (many from Albania) wonderful atmosphere.
Joseph‚Äôs is a gem.
Food was excellent.
Wine was great.
Service very friendly, and accommodating.
Nice Italian place with a really sweet ambiance.
Nice and welcoming .
Really cute bar, interesting service with so many people on the service, but a little disoriented.
The one thing I don't like is when your waiter is topping up your glass with water every second, I get it, they want you to spend a lot of money on the expensive sparkling water, but common you cannot be that aggressive.
The food is good, nice pasta and appetizers, a great place to get together with coworkers and have dinner and a drink.
Food was delicious.
Service was horrible.
We had to finally go to hostess and ask for our bill after we had sat there for 10 minutes after they emptied our table.
The manager brought 2 shots of tequila as an apology (which we did not want) but at least he made an effort.
We found Joseph's looking for another place and decided to try it.
What a nice surprise.
Even though they had a big group celebrating the holidays, they served us like we were the only ones there.
Later, some regulars arrived and were served in the same manner.
Amazing food and wine.
The restaurant was one place who wants to have traditional Italian cuisine.
I was confused between two dishes and Maria helped me choosee the right one.
Enjoed my Lunch here.
Awesome atmosphere to have a great time with some wine and of course don‚Äôt forget their tiramisu üòãüòãüòã
Came here for lunch on a Monday (around 1pm) and was able to walk in without needing reservation.
We got the schnitzel (tried pork and chicken) and also the apple schtrudel, they were all delicious!
The schnitzels also came with 3 sides, so it was a good amount of food even if you are very hungry.
I also loved the vibe of this space.
I will definitely be back for dinner!
Fun spot in FiDi with very good vibes.
I showed up at 6 on a Thursday and was seated immediately.
Our hostess (was also working the bar) was extremely nice and was very helpful with the menu.
I had the pork schnitzel and it was good.
The breading didn‚Äôt really stick too well but it was still good!
Came here twice in two weeks, both for work dinners.
I love the ambience, it's so homey.
Service is also very attentive.
Had schnitzel first time then burger.
Schnitzel was good but made me realize I don't think I have the palette for Austrian good.
Switched  to burger the second time and it was a winner.
Also, Brussel sprouts.
Get them.
Trust me
Excellent menu that changes seasonally, great tasting Austrian fare with a twist.
We were there for an 8pm reservation for 3 on a Thursday evening.
The place was bustling, so it took about 10+ minutes to get seated.
The service staff was wonderful and even the chef was clearing out tables.
The ambiance was great; A couple of blocks down from the 9/11 memorial and the Oculus, Schilling is housed in what seems like a carriage house of 1920s NYC, with interesting industrial touches and curious decor.
There's outdoor enclosed plus sidewalk tables plus the street wall is actually a large glass garage door that was closed for the cold.
Looking forward to returning when in FiDi.
I visited this resturant with a friend of mine who is a huge fan of Austurian cuisine.
We came here to try both schnitzel and apple strudel.
Additionally, we ordered trout rilettes after getting a recommendation from our waitress.
Unfortunately, this food was below my expectations.
First, the trout rilettes were so salty that we could not finish.
The schnitzel was not crispy enough.
The only thing we liked was the desert.
However, the ambiance is pretty good.
You can have a nice time with your friends.
Another note for the resturant is that they should find a solution for the outside door.
It keeps banging and is quite annoying for the people having food inside.
We decided to try some of the local restaurants in the area, and we went to this restaurant following the many reviews.
The food here is okay, I don't think it is the best local food.
As for value for money, it was reasonable.
I like that they serve you with tea to open your meal.
The food was amazing!!
Beef noodle soup, fried dumplings, and general tso's chicken was so crispy- best we've ever had!
The servers were really nice too.
Can't wait to come back!
Excellent, easy 5 stars.
The inside was full when we arrived but they were able to seat us outside immediately.
The fried dumplings were some of the best I've had.
The broccoli beef and pineapple chicken were both fantastic as well.
The meat was all so tender I didn't have to fight with it or pick around anything weird.
Service was attentive but not overbearing.
If you're looking for good Chinese in the city this is the place to go.
Just finished an awesome dinner.
Saturday November 18th 2023.
Authentic Chineserestaurant downstairs.
We ordered wonton soup, egg rolls, fried dumplings, steak kew and sweet and sour chicken.
Everything was excellent.
Very good service and the timing of the food was on point.
Highly recommend HUGE menu.. very polite staff.
Very clean too, especially considering the high activity of customers very fair priced.
The food portions are quite large You will not go home hungry.
I finally popped in to check out what all the rant and raving was about.
The quality of the food was good, the service could be better, but ambience was great.
I met so many great people on my first visit of many.
Not only is this the go to neighborhood spot, but people from all parts of the city and the tri-state area seem to be regulars that enjoy everything this wonderful restaurant has to offer.
I knew I was at the right place when I met a couple who have been coming here all the way from New Jersey for 30+ years once a week.
You‚Äôll find patrons from all walks of life that come together with one thing in common, enjoying what the extensive menu and great service has to offer.
The menu is definitely on the pricier side, so get ready to spend a pretty penny.
Great spot with delicious food.
Portions are massive (in my non-American view anyway) could easily share one dish between two.
Friendly staff, vibe is a bit bright, but the food is a very good.
Easily recommend this place.
Wow love their rice cake.
Huge portion.
Good menu selection.
Fast service and reasonable pricing.
Very flavorfully cooked (probably slightly too much for my liking but maybe it‚Äôs a sauce selection blunder).
Even has wifi.
Clean bathroom.
I was working a gig in NYC, and I was on my way to a different restaurant for dinner when I stumbled upon NoodleLove.
A half hour before they closed and I asked if they were still serving food.
The best customer service so far that I've had in New York.
Steven was the best!
Steven said, of course, and was very helpful in helping me decide.
I want to eat more vegetarian and vegan options, and both Steven and Google recommended the Royal Japchae.
It is absolutely delicious!
Even if you're not vegan.
When the chef is a great chef, they understand how to cook vegan food.
If you want great vegan and vegetarian options, this place is wonderful and the hospitality of the staff is great!.
I took my food to go, unfortunately.
But the atmosphere is beautiful and the music is catchy..
Had a very nice lunch with a friend here!
Great vegan and gluten free options.
I didn't expect the wok bowl (w rice) to be like the best fried rice I've ever had.
Service was great, friendly.
Place has a very unassuming, comfortable vibe.
I'll be back for sure.
The food here is amazing, and such good prices for Soho, you cannot find better here.
The open kitchen is very cool.
Service is very good, drinks are amazing as well!
100% recommend
Place is great, they give large portions and the price is good too.
The roast pork belly is well worth the wait, there is no other place doing roast pig/pork belly like them and I would get that over the BBQ pork, just my opinion because my cuts were not that meaty.
Not sure if I got a bad batch but the cuts of BBQ pork I got were not as juicy and meaty as some of the other pictures here.
I could go to the other stores in the area or in Flushing and get better cuts of roast pork, I do chalk it up to luck of draw, they were serving a lot of people not every cut is going to be good, so I'll go back and give it another try at a later date.
5 stars for the roast pig though, amazing!
Delicious, cheap, and no frills experience.
Arrived right when it opened and there was already a few people ahead of me in line.
We got the roast pork and the roast pig.
We ordered both in the small size and they were heaping with meat.
We had enough for a small portion of leftovers for the next meal.
Definitely would recommend a stop here for yummy Chinese bbq!
We waited in line for about 45 min because we couldn‚Äôt leave NY without getting food from here.
It is well worth the wait.
I had the duck, my husband had the pork.
Both were really good.
There is nowhere to sit so beware that the duck is a little harder to eat standing up, but shouldn‚Äôt sway you from ordering it.
Delicious and affordable prices.
All day.
EVERYDAY.
To take out.
From $5.50 a choice of Roast Pork or Chicken On small rice.
TO $8.50 Large or $6.50 Small ROASTED PORK DUCK CHICKEN
Small takeout shop in Chinatown.
The place is takeout only and you have to wait in line for food (there‚Äôs usually a long wait too).
My girlfriend and I got the small duck over rice ($7) and roast pork over rice ($5.50).
The meat was very flavorful and juicy - went well with the rice.
The best part of this place is the price and value you get - less than $10 for a really good portion of tasty meat.
Other than the value, I would say there isn‚Äôt anything really special about the food - it‚Äôs just some meat over rice.
Overall, I would rate this place a solid 8/10 - it‚Äôs a 10/10 in terms of price but the taste and quality is not noteworthy.
Amazing people.
Amazing food.
Amazing service.
11/10 recommend going here.
The most authentic Italian food ever and had an amazing experience.
Will definitely be back here the next time I visit NYC.
We were so impressed by everything here and cannot say enough good things about this place.
Food was absolutely amazing.
Alex our host was very attentive and lively.
It was so nice to be around.
I got the Lobster Ravioli and Moscato.
All was handmade.
It is delicious.
As my first time in Little Italy, I will definitely come back!
Stopped in for a late lunch after a long day of shopping in SoHo.
Had the cutest table outside with our own personal heater.
Service was very friendly and attentive.
Food was absolutely exceptional.
Had the pesto gnocchi with mussels and an arugula salad.
Would highly recommended to anyone.
Ultra authentic Italian food made with love.
We enjoyed a gorgeous late lunch here.
The restaurant owner, Alex and all of the servers were extremely friendly, welcoming and went out of their way to make our experience special.
The food was scrumptious to boot too!
Truly a Little Italy experience.
Ayman did a wonderful job getting us to a cute little table and recommending some wonderful food!
The food was amazing and took me back to my mom‚Äôs Italian cooking!
Cute, cozy, and friendly!
!
Bartender was wonderful.
He was very accommodating, great personality and made some really good cocktails!
Love the little bar spots in the city
Came here for a late dinner with some friends.
Even at 11p on a Tuesday, this place was popping.
We were a group of 8 but were able to find seating in the back.
The tables were nice and set up well, so we could all interact and chat throughout the dinner.
The food came quickly and was pretty great.
The place had a nice vibe to it in a cool part of town.
Worth checking out!
I've been meaning to visit for some time.
We ended up coming on a weekend for brunch.
Solid vibe, good menu.
Nicely crafted cocktails.
Staff was extremely friendly!
1) seated us within minutes 2) made sure the table was doing alright multiple times 3) great vibes and energy  Outdoor seating was set up nicely!
1) cute aesthetic 2) tables were split by huge dividers 3) heating lamp for warmth  Calamari slapped!
1) crispy 2) golden brown crunch 3) sauces didn't over power the calamari  I ordered Steak and Eggs: 10/10!
1) love me some medium rare steak 2) potatoes were yum 3) eggs and veggies so good  Will definitely come back again.
Thank you for a wonderful outdoor dining experience!
!
Ideal spot for a late weekend dinner with a group music gets loud and there's a great ambiance in a small dense space!
Food was great, relatively large portions and overall surprisingly affordable for what we ordered.
Would definitely come back soon!
The flavors were rich and distinct!
Overall very delicious food and comfortable atmosphere.
Lots of seating options, either cozy booths, spacey tables, or seating at the bar.
The waiter was exceptionally friendly.
The Lamb Kourma was my favorite dish.
Dessert was on the sweet side, but delicious.
However, the bathrooms were in a strange location and not very clean.
Also, we had to ask for the water to stay at our table when we got our drinks.
Recently visited Benares and was absolutely delighted by the experience.
The food here is exceptional, particularly the Kachori, which was perfectly spiced and crispy.
The Spicy Naan and Laccha Parantha were soft and flavorful, complementing every dish beautifully.
The Amritsari fish and Chicken Kali Mirch were standout dishes, each offering a unique and rich taste that was simply unforgettable.
But the highlight of the evening was the surprise from our waiter who brought out a delicious Gulab Jamun cake for my birthday, making the occasion even more special.
The service throughout was impeccable, adding to an overall fantastic dining experience.
Highly recommend Benares for anyone looking for exquisite Indian cuisine and top-notch service.
Came here on a Sunday night for a quick dinner.
Staff were friendly and let us decide for while from their extensive list of menu.
We got one butter chicken (one of the staff‚Äôs recommendations) and a vegetarian curry with bell pepper and cottage cheese.
Rice was included and the curry makes you full faster than you think since it‚Äôs quite dense and rather oily.
Want to try their appetizers next time.
The food and service was wonderful!
We got the sweet corn soup and Kholapuri Misal and it was great!
The soup was sweet and creamy with  a good touch of spice in there.
While the Kohlapuri Misal had the flavour filled beans and the delicious curry with the warm buttery bread.
For the entree we got the Kekada Kari which had the tender crab with the perfectly spiced sauce which hit the spot with the butter roti.
If you eat that while drinking a buttermilk it would make it a game changer!
I will definitely come back to this establishment and recommend people to go and have a good time here.
Benares unquestionably has the best traditional Indian food in all of Manhattan.
The aloo baingan (potatoes and eggplant) and chicken tikka masala were amazing and the Punjabi goat curry was divine.
They have an impressive cocktail list and the masala vodka (chutney and mint forward) was refreshingly unique and tasty.
Our server, Ramita, was incredibly attentive, kind and helpful with recommendations.
After one visit, I‚Äôd confidently choose Benares over any of their competitors (especially those with much higher price points).
The diverse clientele at Uncle Lou fueled my high expectations.
The generously stuffed spring rolls impressed, but the sauce lacked authenticity.
Stuffed eggplants in black bean sauce were decent, yet the sauce was overly thick.
A disappointment with the sticky rice in lotus leaf lo mai gai, lacking flavor.
Research and refinement for this dish would be beneficial.
The staff wasn‚Äôt really attentive.
On a positive note, the toilet standards were commendable.
Everything we ordered was really tasty and perfectly seasoned.
The entire establishment was clean and modern.
Must order: garlic chicken, eggplant, and the walnut shrimp was amazing.
This business also has a great story with Uncle Lou at the center.
I love supporting great small businesses like this.
We went with no reservation at 1pm on a Sunday with 5 people and had no issues getting a table.
I dined at Uncle Lou on the last day of my visit in North America.
At that time, I missed Cantonese food very much.
And Uncle Lou didn‚Äôt disappoint me.
The food is delicious though the taste is slightly different from that in Hong Kong.
Besides, I particularly like the atmosphere of the restaurant.
It is a mixture of East and West.
Customers can order a drink and enjoy watching baseball game while they are waiting for their seats.
Uncle Lou is so smart!
Top-notch Cantonese-style foods that will blow you away.
Every dish we ordered was the best we could've hoped for.
We came as a party of 7 on a busy Thanksgiving day but got our table quite quickly and the servers also worked really fast on every orders.
The restaurant is also spacious and clean, combined with the fairly cheap price tags and big portions make this a top choice for Chinese food.
Great decor and ambience in the heart of Chinatown.
The food is delicious and really hits the spot.
It‚Äôs hard to find a spot in Chinatown that has both great food and great decor/service.
Uncle Lou has both.
It‚Äôs a nice place to bring family and/or friends and serves up all the classics.
We had the Peking pork - which really reminded me of being back in China.
In addition to the eggplant in garlic (wasn‚Äôt the best version I‚Äôve had) and beef he fun - very classic and delicious.
The portions were larger than I expected and definitely will be back!
Title: Terrace Fish & Chips: A Pleasant Surprise in Lower Manhattan  Review:  Dinner at Terrace Fish & Chips on Pearl Street was a refreshing change from the usual bustling eateries of New York.
The place had a bare-bones setup with seating that's hard to come by, hinting at an almost exclusive experience for those who stumble upon it.
It struck me odd that a restaurant in such a busy slice of the city would be so quiet at 4:15 p.m., but the peace was welcome.
One person was holding down the fort, but his demeanor was warm and professional, ensuring my meal was on the table without delay.
Diving into the menu, the choice was simple‚Äîthe day's special caught my attention.
The Fried Flounder with Fresh Fries came out piping hot and in abundance.
The flounder was fried to a satisfying crispness, hiding the tender fish within, while the fries maintained their crisp even as they cooled‚Äîa pleasing duo by any measure.
However, the fried calamari I added on the side didn't quite hit the mark.
It was missing the expected burst of taste, which contrasted with the otherwise flavorful meal.
I washed it all down with a diet coke‚Äîthe only option since the place doesn't serve alcohol, which suited me just fine.
The presentation was no-frills, with the meal served in simple takeaway containers accompanied by disposable utensils.
This was ideal for me, especially needing a quick bite after a trip to Staten Island and heading home.
So, if you're around the Ferry Terminal and need a fast, delicious seafood dish, this spot could be worth the stop.
Although the calamari was a bit of a letdown, the rest of the meal made up for it, and the overall experience was enjoyable.
I give it four stars for the food and the hassle-free dining experience.
A different kind of fast food restaurant because they solely specialize in fried and grilled fish, shrimp and seafood all tasty and well prepared with side dishes and sauces.
My only disappointment was not being able to eat it there since I took order to go.
Their menu is very diverse and reasonably priced.
They sell fake fish there‚Äôs layers of I don‚Äôt know and it feels like rubber and plastic.
Never again
Very friendly staff, amazing quality, and you ‚Äúlive‚Äù the financial district as a local.
We shared a fried flounder with chips (fresh french fries) for $11 and it was delicious and fresh.
If you are a tourist don‚Äôt fall for the overpriced hod-dogs stands in the area.
Follow google maps to this location.
The restaurant is small and simple, but well located and the food is simply delicious.
From brunch to lunch and dinners I absolutely love coming to Grotta Azzurra!
The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere makes you feel like you‚Äôre in Italy!
I love their French toast, eggs Benedict and chicken parmigiana with pasta!
One of the best and oldest in Little Italy.
Since it was the last ‚Äòhot‚Äô summer evening of the year, we chose to sit outside.
It was spacious and other guests were in good manners (not loud or smoking).
We ordered a couple of frozen margaritas and moscato, which were so appropriate for the day!
They gave us some complimentary yum bread with olive oil.
After that we ordered pizza with prosciutto and seafood risotto.
Portion was generous and taste was very classy, just like what you have in Italy.
Price was good for such amazing outdoor space and friendly service.
It was a lovely evening seeing people walk and enjoy their time.
Would definitely recommend this place.
While visiting The Little Italy we saw this corner cafe.
Just ordered cappuccino which was great, but more than that, the atmosphere and environment was amazing!
Like watching the scenes from the Godfather üòÄ
Beautiful old style authentic Italian restaurant.
I had to have the spaghetti and meatballs üòã  and they didn't disappoint !
Would highly recommend this restaurant there's not many left like this in little Italy.
Very laid back place.. they play 80 and 90's hits.
This is a place I would come on a first, second, and even third date.. reasonably priced.. lemme give u your üíê flowers while I'm alive..
The views are just lovely.
We didn't arrive during sunset but apparently many people book their reservations around then.
The food was good, but not very memorable.
At their price range, I expected better.
The drinks were great, however, and even better was the service.
The table we sat at was in the back corner of the restaurant where we could get really good views.
I had requested it and the restaurant honored it, which was a big plus.
However, that corner was very cold with some air conditioning draft coming down on the table.
That didn't ruin the evening but it was certainly a nuisance.
We ended up wearing our *winter* jackets to keep warm.
Opposite of the restaurant is a separate room with a small bar that they sometimes open if they get really busy.
Even if it's not open, you can still get your drinks at the bar, then head over.
It's got couches and small booths to chill at.
It's a nice lounge.
I'd recommend to take advantage of that room, instead of having a meal at the restaurant.
Needs to be top of your list for a special occasion!
Amazing views of the city 60 floors up.. we were very lucky to be placed at a table next to the window.. you cant request this unfortunately but it was my husband‚Äôs birthday!
We had the restaurant week lunch menu and it was all amazing and such great quality for the price.
Service was amazing, really made it a special experience.
Would highly recommend coming for lunch, not sure the views would be as good at night.
Such an amazing experience!
At one point I was looking through the drink book( I say book because it‚Äôs at least 20 pages!)
and was struggling to find the by the glass wine list, an employee noticed and was by my side asking if I needed any help in seconds.
Our server was super knowledgeable and was able to make several spot on recommendations.
It was my 13 yr old daughter‚Äôs first experience at a restaurant like this and she was blown away.
I told her before hand things like notice how when the servers reach in front of you, their face will always be facing you, in between each course they will clear out silverware and bring us the exact utensils we need for our next course.
Etc.
When we arrived, she was looking for all of those things and she kept saying dad look how they cleared out plates, they were always facing us and cleared our  plates all at the same time!
Thanks for making her experience incredible.
It‚Äôs the little things.
Not to mention the food was off the charts.
Such thoughtful pairing of flavor profiles and textures in each dish.
Must try!
The food was just ok but the views were amazing!
The steak was a small portion and I've had tastier steaks but their service was great.
You have to check in at the lobby and be escorted to the elevator so come on time.
I went on a holiday so it wasn't full of wall Street people which allowed us to stay longer and enjoy the ambience
Our experience at Manhatta was nothing short of extraordinary!
Opting for the exquisite 4-course meal paired with a delightful bottle of white wine elevated our dining adventure to new heights.
The attentive and helpful staff ensured that every course was not only expertly served but also presented with an artistic flair that delighted the senses.
Venturing into the more adventurous side of the menu, I selected the BBQ eel and squab courses, both of which were nothing short of culinary masterpieces.
The flavors were not only bold and unique but also flawlessly executed, leaving an indelible impression.
The panoramic views from our table were absolutely breathtaking.
My tip for fellow diners would be to secure an earlier dinner reservation, increasing the likelihood of scoring a coveted window seat to savor the stunning cityscape.
The extensive wine menu was a journey in itself, featuring a diverse selection from various corners of the globe, adding an international touch to our dining experience.
Manhatta is a true gem that tantalizes both the taste buds and the senses, making it a must-visit destination for any discerning diner.
Make sure to make your reservation ahead of time so you can get the times you want and hopefully get by a window seat ;)
Me and my friends went to this restaurant for a special occasion a few weeks ago.
The food and service was very good.
I ordered a pasta dish and enjoyed it thoroughly although it was quite heavy and I was able to take it home to eat later.
My friend also ordered the a pizza which he liked.
The service was great.
The food looked good but did not taste good.
We got the Serafina burger which tastes pretty regular.
It wasn‚Äôt remarkable and tastes like any other burger.
The fries were stiff.
We also had the spaghetti carbonara and that was way too salty.
I could not tolerate it.
I love octopus, so I was very excited to see that it was a special appetizer the evening we ate here.
It was generous in size and cooked perfectly - no easy task!
My spouse very much enjoyed the appetizer of toasted bread with melted parmesan and prosciutto, too.
As a pasta entree, I had the bow tie pasta with shrimp.
The amount of shrimp was very generous, and the pasta cooked al dente.
The sauce was a little overpowering for me as far as the lemon flavor is concerned.
Too much so which at least made it easier to not make a pig of myself.
Spouse ordered chicken parmesan.
The penne pasta served with it was cooked too al dente for him, and the chicken was flattened so much that you could not taste it past the breading, sauce and cheese.
We arrived early evening for dinner and got a table immediately with quick service.
Very nice restaurant, good service and pretty good food for a chain restaurant .
We were all surprised with the quality of food and pretty good service.
Nice ambiance as well.
Good appetisers and pasta dishes, cheeseburger was also great, very crunchy French fries, loved it.
Food and service were good.
Had a good time.
I ordered a salmon with avocado, I think they can add something else to this plate.
Charming establishment in the Little Italy portion of downtown Manhattan.
Low light and romantic air are set by dark walls and table lamps that welcome intimate conversation and togetherness.
My girlfriend and I stopped in for a glass of wine while attending the San Genero feast and we were pleasantly surprised.
Our little section near the bar area was comfortable and inviting.
This place is awesome.
The decor is wonderful, the service was outstanding and the food was great.
I celebrated my birthday here and I would definitely come back.
Came here for the happy which ends at 7pm, and ended up grabbing dinner as well.
The service was okay.
Our server didn‚Äôt know the happy hour cocktails, told us it was refreshing and ended up being the sweetest pomegranate cocktail.
That‚Äôs fine, but then she was never around when we wanted service and forgot half our order.
We had to ask for the side dish which came after everyone was done their meals.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I liked the watermelon margarita but can‚Äôt say the same for green machine.
üòÖ I felt like I am eating something really healthy but it wasn‚Äôt that tasty.
And that‚Äôs what i was going for so, that‚Äôs good i guess.
Great little neighborhood bar.
We chose it because of the cosmopolitans and the brunches shown on the TV show by the sex in the city girls.
My family and I were visiting from Dallas for Christmas and this little bar was on my bucket list.
It did not disappoint.
Charlie was our waiter and the absolute BEST!!!!
Ask for him if you go!
Stopped by this restaurant while in Chinatown and had a great meal.
My party went around early lunch time and there were not a lot of people there.
We were seated immediately and service was fast after ordering.
Everything we ate was good and if you like soup dumplings, this is the place for you.
I enjoyed how it was right off the street, but it was quiet inside.
There was a bathroom which was clean, but the steps to get there are a little steep for those with mobility issues.
Personally, one of my favorite things was the boba tea I got because in my opinion they make it better than some other places I tried in the same area.
Waiter stayed out of the way but was available when needed.
Would eat here again.
It had been a few years since I had eaten a meal in Chinatown, so I was really excited to try out Supreme.
We had heard several other restaurants were also great but Supreme seemed big enough to accommodate our large party size of 11.
They have a big table in the back that seats about 10 but we were able to stuff 11 around it.
All of us were so happy with the food!
This is the way good Chinese food is supposed to be.
The quality was so much better than anything we've ever had in Florida, they aren't even worth comparing.
We had a lot of food, but the highlights included: the crab & pork soup dumplings, beef lo mein, crispy duck, sesame chicken, garlic eggplant, wuxi style ribs, and the fried chicken wings.
Yes, all of those were highlights!
Beer selection includes only TsingTao and Sapporo.
Would be a cool upgrade if they brought in some Chinese beer not available in the US like Snow or Yanjing.
Service was very fast and attentive.
They didn't get anything wrong in our huge order other than bringing us an extra plate of soup dumplings, which ended up being a blessing because we definitely needed more.
Overall, fantastic experience!
I highly recommend Supreme.
This would be a regular spot for me if I lived in the city.
Pro tip: We went on a Saturday at 11:30 and it was very easy to get a table.
Pros: prices reasonable Cons: found 2 strands of hair in my food Ordered the fried rice for a late night snack.
I found one piece of hair while eating and then another.
I ordered to go so I didn‚Äôt see the hair until I got home and sat down to actually eat.
Disgusted!
Delicious place to get Chinese food!
It's usually pretty busy in the evening so get there earlier if possible to avoid a wait.
The scallion pancakes are incredible and so flakey!
I also tried the house made vegetable lo mein which had the best noodles I've ever had.
The general tsos tofu is incredible as well.
Service was fast and the dining area is nice.
This place is cash only though so make sure to bring cash.
Been a few years since i came here.
Walked by today and wanted to try the soup dumplings.
I ordered them and they arrived piping hot.
They taste as i remembered.
Really good.
I will come back just for this.
Glad they didn't change.
Great food, decent service, phenomenal atmosphere - would definitely go back!
Glad we had reservations as there was a long wait when we walked in.
The decorations vibe and atmosphere are amazing.
Loved the spinning motorcycle around the bar, the unique photo decorated wall and the hard to miss orange booths!
We have been to one of their other locations and got the same feeling which is what I was hoping for.
The nachos were good, the guacamole was fresh and the salsas were tangy, fresh and flavorful!
The black bean quesadillas were okay but the smoky flavor was a bit too much for me.
The food came out quick and the portions are very generous.
The only callout was having to flag down our waiter a few times to get silverware for our meal, place additional orders and at the end to get a check.
Totally understandable as the restaurant was full but she just seemed a bit overwhelmed.
The restaurant is spacious but can get very loud when it fills up.
Overall the service was okay, the food was above average, vibe was a 10/10.
Would recommend for a good bang for your buck with the food portions.
This is definitely one of the best spots Philly has to offer.
I love absolutely love it here.
The food here always excedes expectations and we‚Äôve had the same server both time, Sophie, and she‚Äôs full of light and so so kind.
Anytime I had a menu question she could answer it no problem.
They have a Photo Booth as well and that seems so popular - I have not given it a shot yet.
Definitely check out the bathrooms too - if you can find them.
If you‚Äôre on the fence between here and anywhere else for a date night, pick here.
You‚Äôll impress every date.
Funky, artsy and cool vibe is what you get when you enter El Vez.
On one side of the restaurant you have the bar and simple seating, and on the other side you have booths made of velvet(I think).
I recommend making reservations because it gets busy.
The food is quite tastey.
My party of four ordered El Vez Guacomole, El Vez burger, chicken Quesadillas,Tortilla Soup, chicken(spicy)& short rib Enchiladas.
Margaritas to try are the Pink Cadillac and Spicy Pineapple delish!
If you go around the lunch hour you have choice to order on the Brunch menu or lunch menu.
My next visit will be for dinner requesting the velvet seating.üòä
I came here for restaurant week with some friends during the fall.
It‚Äôs so hard to get a reservation here, as this is a pretty popular spot in Philly.
We understood why!
The food is incredible, staff were friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is welcoming and fun.
Will definitely be returning here, if you have the opportunity to get a rez here definitely check this place out !
!
My friend and I had a nice night here.
I enjoyed the food but overall this place isn‚Äôt really anything special.
For the price point I‚Äôd imagine something more mind blowing.
I knew this place wasn‚Äôt going to be authentic but I wanted to be surprised by the fusion items and they turned out to be just okay, Some things were done well like, the meat in the tacos were spectacularly spiced and well cooked.
But other things were mediocre at best, like the seafood options did not taste very appetizing.
The deserts were yummy but nothing special.
The lights were moody and decor was nice to look at, the service was good too.
If you live near the area and want to impress someone I would take them here but it‚Äôs not going to be a restaurant I come back too.
High value French restaurant!
The food is great and the service is nice.
Yellow bulbs are used and I personally feel it's a bit too dark.
Loudness of the crowd is not a thing the restaurant can control but I would love to point it out.
The waiter separated our soup evenly into two cups when noticed we wanted to share, very heartwarming.
Parc is one of the most well-known restaurants in the area.
It indeed offers great service, delicious food, and parisien atmosphere.
Since it‚Äôs so popular, be aware you may need to wait even if you have reservation.
It also may be quite loud.
The restaurant has a very nice ambiance inside and also offers outdoor seating.
We were able to make a same day reservation which was awesome.
We were presented with a full bread basket with several different kinds of bread as soon as we sat down.
Menu has several great options and we really enjoyed our food.
We got the salmon and the scallops, and I recommend both.
There was a large group that rented out some space for a birthday gathering right next to us and they were a little loud.
Didn‚Äôt really bother us, but the manager proactively removed some items from our bill - cutting it in half - to apologize.
We really appreciated the service and it‚Äôs obvious the manager cares about his customers and their experience.
Thank you!
!
Nestled in a quaint corner, this charming French restaurant transports you straight to the heart of Paris with its ambiance.
On this visit, we decided to try something different and went for the non-French pasta dishes, which were absolutely delicious.
I also have to give a special shout-out to their bread basket - a real treat!
The service was commendable, and the overall ambiance was very enjoyable.
Thanksgiving Dinner 2023 was amazing!
The atmosphere and location are perfect.
I also had the steak dinner for Christmas Eve 2023.
I wanted to give Kathy (looks like Jen Aniston) our waitress a shout out.
She went above and beyond.
Her personality and kindness made the experience a 10/10.
Please acknowledge a job well done by your server.
The restaurant operates with a cozy ambiance and offers a variety of breakfast options that are well-loved by its visitors.
Reviews frequently mention the welcoming staff and the quality of the food.
For instance, one review appreciates the friendly service and the fact that the restaurant gets their tea with milk order just right, indicating attention to detail in service‚Äã‚Äã.
Another review from Restaurantji praises the extensive menu and the clean environment, despite a minor hiccup with a preference for how ketchup is served with fries‚Äã‚Äã.
If I could give this place 10 stars I would.
The service is always amazing and the food is delicious.
I used to get a tuna sandwich for lunch from here everyday and now I get breakfast here every morning.
They're the only place that gets my tea with milk order correctly and they asked questions to make sure they made it how I'd asked.
I love this place.
Amount of food is not worth the cost compared to other spots around here.
Got a breakfast sandwich, they used 1 egg and 1 piece of meat‚Ä¶disrespectful.
Wasn‚Äôt too busy at this particular hour.
First time here.
Just needed something quick to eat before my train to Trenton as I did not have breakfast.
Seems fairly clean from my view‚Ä¶ the menu is pretty extensive, lots of options.
I‚Äôm just getting fries.
I am waiting for a second batch because they put the ketchup on my fries.
Much too messy for me.
I prefer my ketchup on the side.
You order through a screen so my suggestion is to make this request verbally as the option is not present when using the system.
She did seem a bit annoyed when speaking to the cook in her language, but for the most part the service was reasonable
Food is good.
Great service and decent prices!
üëåüèº they sell alcohol there so sometimes you have people there that just drink.
Zero parking.
Very solid late night spot.
They host live blues on Wednesdays which was definitely a fun vibe.
A comfortable and homey environment.
Food was great for the spot being mainly a bar.
Would come back on a quick work week late night food run!
Overall not bad .
I had a strawberry margarita that taste like a regular margarita.
I had a rice bowl that was great but I had some burnt rice which made it hard to enjoy.
The churros were good just a little doughy in the inside.
Our server was great , very nice and helpful .
The atmosphere was nice however it was very loud which made it hard to hold conversations.
A wonderful spot to step in and order some authentic Hispanic food.
Went with a Cuban sandwich that had all ingredients balanced that balanced well with one other.
The amount of ham, about three pieces of thickly sliced didn‚Äôt overpower the amount of pernil and the extra condimentes of mustard and mayo didn‚Äôt take overtake the meal.
The bread held everything together well and didn‚Äôt make the sandwich intimidating.
Super delicious and should be ordered for more occasions!
This burger plate was a wonderful experience!
There are so many levels of flavor.
The  curly fries were a surprise.
The ketchup had an addictive kick, and the jalape√±os elevated this plate.
I've been here a couple times and I love this place.
It's one of  my new little hole in the wall spots after a hard day's work.
The wings are just how I like them, spicy and saucy.
The Guacamole and chips never disappoint.
I like their margarita flavors, reg,  spicy strawberry, mango, all delightful in a glass or a pitcher.
The pork buns are good along with the freedom tacos and chicken nachos.
I've recently expanded to the Chicken enchiladas and plantains and they were really good together.
I also tried the passion fruit margaritas.
It was ok but strawberry will forever be my first love.
Just went and had dinner here today.
All our food, cocktails, and the service were really great.
The Red Sangria is really tasty!
The calamari was PERFECT!
Just salty enough with really light, crunchy breading!
The Soy Ginger Salmon is really good!
My only qualm is that the couscous was warm, almost cold while the salmon and roasted vegetables were steaming hot when the plate came out.
Otherwise, everything else was great.
Would definitely come back :)
The smell of grilled food attracts me every time I pass by this place.
Last week, I finally I had a chance to to try it out for brunch with a friend.
We both opted for 18hr brisket press.
Personally, not my cup of tea.
I found out I‚Äôm not a fan of this meat style.
But my friend enjoyed it very much.
The sandwich comes with coleslaw and fries.
This restaurant is a great place for quality lunch.the food is very tasteful and is served in a very exceptable time frame.the staff all get along and work great with there costumers,and co workers.it was a very fast and pleasurable lunch an service.the price is also very satisfying.
Their crispy chicken & sesame salad is so amazing and so filling!
Their blackberry margaritas are good but could be stronger!
Their sweet potato fries were good but I prefer them to be more crispy!
Overall, great restaurant and great service!
Very cool corner place with big window views.
Absolutely the best service personnel I've seen in a long time.
All three brunch plates we ordered were delicious with large portion sizes.
Loved my spinach & salmon eggs benedict.
Definitely will return on my next Philly visit.
I‚Äôve always loved High Street Bakery so when this restaurant opened I knew I had to try it out - expectations were exceeded!
Brunch was delicious and visually really pretty, the interior had a lovely & elegant atmosphere.
Pastries were delectable as usual, the pistachio croissant was brilliant, and brunch dishes were flavorful and fresh.
I want to come here every weekend ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wanted to try and waited too long!
The bakery visit was perfect for what I wanted at the time, which was a sandwich and coffee.
The turkey goddess sandwich deliciously was made to order, fresh everything.
In addition to baked goods and coffee, there are also soft drinks and to-go items in a refrigerated case.
Two 2 top tables for your convenience.
I will definitely be back.
Alli was the most gracious attendant.
Welcoming and pleasant !
The music selection while I was there contributed to this wonderful atmosphere.
I had great brunch on Sunday.
All the breads and food I ordered were great.
So I visited bakery after a few weeks.
The scones were really great!
I had fantastic time at High Street!
Cabbage Caviar appetizer was to die for ‚ù§Ô∏è For the main portion I had mushroom pasta and it was one of the best pastas I have ever eaten.
Highly recommended and the next time I am in Philly, I will definitely come back to this place!
Our server was fantastic and was able to recommend great wines that complemented our meals.
Another great meal at the new High Street!
(Not a great pic of the menu but thought I‚Äôd be helpful to see!)
the space is on point, and the booth we had so enjoyable with the Philadelphia themed decorations.
The food was awesome!
We had most of the menu and really can‚Äôt go wrong.
I love being able to share a salad and small plates, pizza and pasta, and an entree if you so desire.
It‚Äôs epicurean causal with fantastic food.
Beer and wine list were a hit.
Staff were super friendly and helpful.
We were staying at the Mariott for a conference and decided to get breakfast.
The Chesapeake Benedict was outstanding.
The mounds of crab meat and perfectly poached eggs deserved a chefs kiss.
The breakfast potatoes were absolutely delish.
It didn't look like much food but I couldnt finish it all.
My friend had a philly cheesesteak omelet that she enjoyed.
My other buddy got the classic breakfast and loved it.
None of us were able to finish evetything on our plates...definitely a great start to the day.
Its been 5 hrs and we are still full.
So you can forget the menu that is on this site.
The real menu is nothing like it.
A cheesesteak for $17 was excellent, however.
I asked to split it with my son and they brought it out already divided into 2 plates with fries on each.
It was exceptional.
The Chorizo taco's my friend ordered were a smaller size meal but excellent as well with an interesting meaty dip with chips.
Food was amazing...but very slow!
We ordered from the pre fixe menu, getting a choice of a house salad, an entree $32 or less, and a dessert.
($45) It took a half hour to get our salads, and they brought my companion the wrong dressing.
After clearing the salads, it was at least another half hour before we got entr√©es.
I ordered the beef shank, and it was outstanding!
Companion ordered the ahi tuna, and agreed it was outstanding.
Waited another half hour or more for desserts, and they brought out the wrong one for my guest.
What we had was delicious.
When the bill came, my guest was charged for a beverage he had ordered, but didn't receive because they were out of it.
(It seems he had the bad luck this night!)
I feel we got great value for the money, and the food...really amazing.
I like a leisurely meal, but this was a little too slow.
So make sure you have the time to spend, be very patient, and you're in for a fabulous meal!
I‚Äôm in from out of town staying at the hotel while I recover from a procedure at CHOP and this included being here over the Thanksgiving holiday.
The restaurant and their staff went above and beyond making sure I had an amazing Thanksgiving dinner with dessert brought up to my room for the holiday and made sure I had everything I needed.
They even included a handwritten card that was so thoughtful and meaningful.
All the food was so good, especially the stuffing and the mini pumpkin pies!
Food was sad and overpriced.
The Pinot Gris was undrinkable, waiter offered to take it back, and to top it off my roast chicken entree was laughable.
It was the size of a sparrow and laden with gravy.
Hubby had crab cake which was good but only 1 small crab cake.
Cocktails were outrageously expensive.
Our server nonetheless was gracious and offered a dessert on the house.
For the price of our dinner we could have had a wonderful meal at a top restaurant.
Altho convenient if staying at the Marriot, I would not eat here.
We had a lovely experience at this restaurant.
If you are looking for delicious vegan Chinese food, this is a great option!
Not only do they have a full vegetarian section, but any of the vegetable Noodle or rice dishes they will make vegan.
We ordered the Mapo Tofu and Vegetable Chow Fun and it was absolutely delicious!
The flavours were amazing and the portions were so big that we have enough to eat for breakfast tomorrow.
The photos I have are of half eaten food because the food smelled so good, I forgot to take photos before we got started.
The atmosphere was also nice, there were beautiful decorations, the entire restaurant is small, with little space to maneuver around but that made is very cozy on a cold day, and the bathrooms were clean and well kept with supplies.
The service was also fast and friendly.
I highly recommend this restaurant, we'll definitely be back.
My recent visit to this restaurant in Chinatown yielded a mixed experience.
The food offered a blend of hits and misses.
We ordered fried dumplings, which while slightly overcooked and bulky, possessed a flavorful sauce that enhanced their taste.
We also got rice noodles with shrimp and chicken which was passable in taste, accompanied by generous portions.
Yet the starter soup was rather unpalatable.
The Hunan chicken dish was satisfactory but left room for improvement.
On the brighter side, the shrimp fried rice was enjoyable, offering a decent flavor profile.
Regrettably, the service fell short of expectations.
We were served water in unclean glasses, indicating a lapse in hygiene standards.
Moreover, the incident where the aged waiter accidentally spilled water while clearing our table was handled quite insensitively.
His dismissive attitude, making light of the situation without an apology, was disappointing.
The restaurant itself seemed to lack proper cleanliness and hygiene, evident throughout the premises.
While some might find it reasonable for the price, the overall hygiene concerns and lackluster service make it unlikely for me to revisit anytime soon.
We have been to Chinatown thousands of times and always passed by this restaurant and never tried it before(wired).
It is definitely on our ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list.
We tried it tonight.
My husband ordered beef noodle, I had some food already so only ordered fried chicken.
The server( maybe the owner), he is so nice.
The way he served made me feel like going to a friend‚Äôs house, not a restaurant!
Lighted up my day!
The noodle taste good, fried chicken was ok. We definitely will be back to try other food.
If you want to eat Taiwanese food, this is your first choice.
As a Taiwanese, I personally recommend it!
The clerk's service is also very good.
He will chat with you and will bring you a pot of hot tea.
The service is very attentive.
It should be noted that each portion of the meal is large, and one portion can feed two people, so it is recommended to order one to taste first and then order again if you are not full.
Glad this place still around.
Laughing Buddha statue still welcoming.. first time since '92... wow... still open 'til 2am in weekend.
Korean server very kind.
I had the duck appetizer it was fresh, delicious and cooked to perfection.
I also had the garlic eggplant chicken which was lovely.
The portions are huge, one main is enough for two.
There wasn‚Äôt an ambience as such basically a few tables, but the staff was very welcoming and warm.
I loved the food here.
I got the chicken,  duck, and pork over rice.
Everything tasted great.
The tea was excellent as well.
I wish they would give you more rice with the meal, but the price was still very reasonable.
Highly recommend.
You don‚Äôt go here for the atmosphere- you go for the food.
It‚Äôs a small place, with five tables total that does an amazing amount of takeout business besides their dine in business.
We had steamed pork dumplings which were good.
We had the House Special Pan Fried Noodles and the Shrimp with Snow Peas and Mushrooms which were both excellent.
Portions were generous and the service was good as well.
We definitely plan to return.
This is a hidden gem in Philly.
The roasted pork was perfect and most melted in my mouth.
Duck was phenomenal, all the greens were tasty and fresh.
10x better than any other place with a line out the door, which Lau Kee should have.
Will be back for this amazing food and kind staff.
Authentic Cantonese cuisine  Ordered crispy crunchy roast duck 1/4 for 11$, it is crunch on the skin and juicy in the inside, it is cooked to perfection suiting canto style duck.
9.5/10  Shrimp dumplings 8* for 7.5$, tasty shrimp coated with bread cloth, dipped in sweet & sour sauce, you won't regret, trust the cat what you should order.
9/10  Meow~
We were craving pho on a chilly afternoon and this spot did not disappoint.
Very friendly service and the pho was on point!!
Good prices and just an overall great experience, got our party of 8 seated quickly!
Nice place.
Service was ok. Had to wave down waiter for more water and tea.
Had the summer rolls.
Lacking a bit.
No mint or cilantro.
Peanut dip was a littler watery and different than I have had before.
Just not my style.
Vermicelli bowl was good.
Had shrimp, pork, and spring rolls.
I did really enjoy that and the fish sauce was ok.
Overall good, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go back.
A cold day in Philly made this stop even more perfect.
We stopped in for pho and it was just what we needed.
A nice family running the place and it was very good.
Thank you!
Nice Viet Pho place near Chinatown, just your normal Pho place.
Not the most authentic, but for a quick affordable meal.
It a good Pho place.
I've been to Philly twice now and both times, this place hit the spot after a night of music festivities.
I will continue to come back.
Thank you for the delicious pho!
In the sprawling culinary landscape of Philadelphia, the quest for dim sum beckoned, guiding us to Dim Sum Garden.
A Shanghai-style sanctuary, its reputation preluded our visit, prompted by the culinary curiosity of my visiting mother-in-law and our own eagerness as new Philly area residents.
The crown jewels of our dining experience were, unequivocally, the soup dumplings -- every flavor.
Each delicate pouch was a burst of savory excellence, a testament to the art of Shanghai dim sum that could easily become an all-day indulgence.
Yet, beyond these pockets of perfection, the magic waned.
The Spicy Shrimp Dumplings, expected to tantalize, instead whispered tales of store-bought origins, leaving a trail of culinary disappointment in their wake.
Service at Dim Sum Garden walked the line of dim sum tradition--neither remarkable nor disappointing, it was the expected rhythm in the bustling ambiance of a dining room that felt more intimate than expansive.
Navigating this space with a travel stroller presented its own adventure, a maneuver we might think twice about undertaking again.
For the soup dumpling aficionado, Dim Sum Garden stands as a beacon.
Yet, caution to those venturing beyond: not all that steams is gold.
This spot finds its stride in casual dining and welcomes small families into its fold, offering a slice of Shanghai amidst the Philadelphia hustle.
In the spirit of constructive culinary exploration, inspired by the late great Anthony Bourdain, our journey continues.
Dim Sum Garden, with its highs and lows, serves as a reminder of the diverse tapestry of dining experiences that our new home has to offer.
Here's to more adventures exploring Philly and beyond.
I'm mostly leaving a review to say that this unassuming item called a "potato beef pie" (?
I think?
I didn't even pay attention) turned out to be an unexpectedly delectable flattened croquette.
Otherwise, this place is a serviceable dim sum spot ‚Äî though from my (spoiled?)
days in Chicago & NYC, I felt the small plates menu was a bit limited, and I missed having a full page to choose from (also no way carts would have fit in the narrow passageways here).
We went on a busy night on a busy weekend, so I tried not to begrudge the waitstaff for hurrying us along and practically shooing us from the table before the last of us had returned from the bathroom.
If you have not tried Chinese Dim Sum, this is the place to experience it.
There are several restaurants in Philly Chinatown that serves Dim Sum, but this is our go-to place.
All dumplings are freshly made in-house.
So some of the dishes may require 15-20 wait for it to be properly steamed or fried.
Clearly, some of the wait staff may not be as fluent in English as they are with Mandarin or Cantonese.
So please be understanding of this.
The place is usually very busy, and may need to be patient on drinks and food.
Also, be sure to bring cash, as this they only take cash.
However, there is a ATM inside the entrance of the restaurant, just in case.
LOVE their soup dumplings especially the Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings!!
The Hot & Sour Soup is good too‚Äîbig portion and well flavored.
They only accept cash here, but there is an ATM outside.
Really great place to eat dimsum cash only though they have an ATM in the front that charges a 2$ fee but it was worth it, I ordered pan fried beef dumplings, pan fried pork and nappa, spicy spicy pork soup dumplings and the pumpkin cakes all met my expectations well.
Atmosphere was good restroom was clean.
One of my favorite places to have a lunch.
Super healthy food and convenient location - right in my building.
Staff is very welcoming and friendly.
Simply awesome.
Great flavors and reasonably priced.
If we lived nearby, we would eat here often.
You can find gluten-free places; you can find vegan places; rarely can you find a place that offers a wide variety of items that are both.
I would love to know what the actual hours are for this place because my friend and I got there around 7pm Saturday evening and employees were clearly in the location and the door was locked with a sign saying the updated hours till 8:30 on Saturday.
I knocked on the door a few times to get their attention and hopefully an explanation and was beautifully ignored.
The funny part is that the employees did not seem to be packing up food, but rather putting more out an hr before closing with absolutely no customers.
Hours need to be updated and if something is preventing opening the doors maybe a small sign can be placed since the folks with the information refuse to share it or acknowledge their customers.
Great take on a healthy ‚Äòbowl‚Äô.
We got the dry rubbed chicken and lemon Za‚Äôtar chicken.
Everything was very fresh.
The dry rubbed chicken is more spicy and we liked it more.
Ha ha.
The portions were just enough.
Nice and cozy atmosphere.
Would definitely recommend it if you are in the area and looking for a healthy spot.
Great menu items and a welcome respite from the over processed, chain restaurant options.
My meal was custom made and a great value as well.
Service was fast and polite.
I'll definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu items.
I was surprised that this place is now more of a Vietnamese spot!
Friendly service, fast preparation, clean restaurant.
There is a cool room upstairs where it looks like they host live music.
Didn't catch it this time around but it looks like a cool venue.
-Highly recommend the pork rice platter, absolutely delicious!
- The shrimp toast were very different than the Thai style I am used to, but quite good.
Very strong sesame flavor.
-The bread they use for the bahn mi here is PERFECTION, and overall I would say the sandwich was good.
In my personal opinion (as a self-proclaimed bahn mi snob) I did feel the strong taste of the sauce on the chicken overwhelmed the flavor balance of the sandwich, which could be overcome by toning it down a little and/or having a stronger pickled flavor on the vegetable and more herbs to balance it out.
Nice relaxing atmosphere.
Service was polite and fast.
Food was wonderful.
For the amount of food we got, including a free soup, it was a great value.
I had the shrimp pad thai, and my friend had the Singapore noodles.
ABSOLUTELY DELISHHHH!!
Every time I come to Philly, this place is a MUST!
Food is so good, staff are friendly and very attentive!
The Pho, is my favorite, but truly everything on menu is very good!
!
The crispy sesame chicken was soggy and the flavors were subpar compared to other similar restaurants in the area.
Fried rice was tasty and rolls were good.
However, overall disappointing.
If looking for your staple take out or delivery Chinese, this one interaction will not keep my family coming back.
Our favorite place to takeout in Philly!
We love their sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, hot and sour soup, any fried rice, and any lo mein.
Delicious food.
Great portion sizes.
Awesome food court option for a tasty lunch.
Spicy chk platter is a go-to and the people are always super friendly and fast even when busy during lunch rushes
Super pleased with this dining experience.
Very friendly people who care.
Prices are low considering the fresh food.
We had the tasty hummus and the Mediterranean chicken salad which was delicious and plentiful.
Easy to customize the salad with ingredients you want.
Good meals for 2 people under $20.
DELICIOUS!
Got the lemon chicken wrap, twice..its AMAZING.
The quality of the ingredients are so fresh and flavourful.
The man who makes the wraps is a gem!
So friendly and nice!
Greets you with a smile!
My new favorite place to grab a good lunch üòã trying the falafel and hummus next time I go.
Cant wait!
This place has everything you'd want and need from an establishment located in a Mall Food Court.
Their chicken is grilled perfectly and is always fresh.
Good amount of options to choose from and the services is terrific.
I don't understand all the negative reviews from other people here.
They just don't make sense.
The sirloin kabab was not up to par.
This restaurant is like a chipote/subway Mediterranean style.
My kabab was very cold and it did not taste good.
The customer service was terrible.
He had no smile on his face whatsoever.
I found this restaurant using grub app but I wish I didn't.
I'm giving it two stars because the food did come fast and for the price it wasn't bad.
They do give good portions.
I'm hoping to give this place a try again and hope it tastes better than before.
We ordered two burgers : ShackBurger and Shack Stack with spicy cheese  fries ( Cheese sauce on sides).
The fries were the best but the burgers didn‚Äôt disappoint us as well.
The service was okay.
The food was relatively quick.
The place wasn't very crowded though it was kind of late,  around 10 PM.
I was in a rush, but wanted a good burger, so stopped by this place.
Can't complain too much about the food, but for the price, it's just a burger and fries.
It's probably a fun place to hit up with a group, or a later night snack, but I can't be a regular because the value is just not there.
There are other places I'd rather pay $20 for a meal.
Wouldn't mind going again, but not going out of my way to visit.
Shake Shack‚Äôs location is just perfect.
They make always tasteful and juicy burgers.
I like ShackBurger more than others.
I‚Äôm not huge fan of French fries, but most of time I order their cheese fries which is really good and delicious.
Their service is ok, not any complaints but someone needs to check and clean restroom more often.
Went back to try this location again and had a beef burger instead - it was delicious and my experience was very different from my previous review.
I think the beef is probably better than the chicken at Shake Shack so perhaps stick to that.
Happy to upgrade my review to a 4 :)  Original review below:  Small portions and mediocre chicken burger.
3 items here were over $18.
Burger was fine but nothing special.
Didn‚Äôt feel like there were many fries at all.
Plenty of seating and self-serve water.
Easy ordering process using the provided machines and then they brought our food to our table.
You bus your own table when you're done.
The chocolate shake was great and I appreciate that they have a good vegetarian option for burgers.
It's kinda pricey though, for fast food.
After massage right across the street this is the perfect place to get cheap late night food.
5 stars for 5 reasons  1.
The minced lamb roll is perfect!
Right amount of spice and seasoning.
I thought it was better than the chicken roll.
2.
Super cheap about $6 for the rolls!
3.
A lot of meat for what you pay  4.
Fast service  5.
Mango/rose lassi is on point!
Loved Masala Kitchen's kati rolls.
Got a few paneer kathi rolls and a potato roll and they were very flavorful and delicious and made very well.
Also had the mango lassi which was great.
Cozy spot for a quick meal.
Would highly recommend!
!
Popped in to try a quick roll.
Never had a kati roll.
Ordered the chicken tawa and it was ready very quickly and nicely packaged.
It was extremely tasty and filling.
The price was just right.
The hot sauce they served in the pump was outstanding.
The atmosphere was nothing special but the music was good.
The service was extremely pleasant and friendly.
I would stop back to try something else.
One of the reasons I‚Äôm giving this place a zero star is because the employee(s) who take orders at the counter are sometimes so obnoxious.
During my last visit, I had interacted with their female employee 3 times and she just stares at you blank, she doesn‚Äôt even have the decency to smile or say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù when you‚Äôre super polite and you keep saying ‚Äúthank you so much‚Äù.
Also, other folks who are preparing the food are not that great either when it comes to welcoming your customer with a simple smile.
I usually like their food and I have visited this place multiple times, I haven‚Äôt had terribly bad experiences apart from a few instances when the chicken biryani had chicken that was totally stale and dark and completely inedible.
This place needs to learn that they need to be more pleasant and employ people that have some basic manners and a positive attitude.
Another reason to give this a zero star is their filthy tables.
Their wooden tables literally have food particles stuck in between the cracks and they don‚Äôt even care to clean it.
Looks like the food has been collecting in the crevices for years.
Delighted with the Kaati rolls!
Exceptional taste and quality.
A flavorful experience that left me thoroughly satisfied.
Highly recommend!
Update: went back to eat in and the Birria tacos were nice and crispy.
Still very delicious!
I highly recommend them.
Also recommend the chicken nachos!
DELICIOUS Birria tacos!
They were so flavorful and the consom√© was mouth watering.
My only takeaway would be that the tacos were really soaked so they were falling apart a bit but they were so good that it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal lol.
Also, their name is now ‚ÄúEl caracol‚Äù I was a bit confused since it was my first time here, I thought I was at the wrong place.
The staff was friendly, I would definitely recommend to any Birria taco enthusiast like myself üôåüèº
Charming and quaint location serving quality tacos and burritos.
Affordable fare and friendly service.
I am a long time fan, definitely recommend.
Had both the vegetarian bean burrito and the chorizo burrito, the latter came recommended by the house.
10/10 delicious.
I recommend the chorizo personally, and I predict any of their burritos will be excellent.
Very kind and gracious service as well.
Looking forward to returning.
Delicious Birria tacos, and guac was nice and fresh.
Staff is very nice, personable and fast.
Everything look good and fresh.
They were very nice
Came during restaurant week and they have a great menu selection.
The customer service is unmatched.
My toddler fell asleep in her stroller and the hostess and manager were so accommodating.
It was hard to find a table that could fit the stroller out of the way of guest but they really went out of their way to make it possible.
Truly appreciated all their help!
Our waiter was very nice and quick.
The food was delicious and fresh.
We found street parking that was only a 2 min walk.
The restaurant had a really cozy and peaceful vibe.
Overall I highly recommend this restaurant.
We visited on Friday 09/15/23 at around 7:30pm.
The hostess that sat us was very nice and pleasant.
She was great.
Our waiter, I think his name was Tom.
He had a star tattoo behind his ear.
My man was great!
The food was delicious.
We had the lobster and shrimp ravioli in a white cream sauce.
Dessert was slam'n.
The reason for my 3 star is that human waste is right outside the door.
It looks like the outside hasn't been power washed or cleaned in a while.
We sat upstairs, and our chairs had stains.
The booth across from our seat, the bottom seat was bust open (you can actually see the booth seat in my first picture).
All the booths were light color, they were dingy and very dirty looking.
I saw Mickey run across the floor numerous times.
It's things like this that make you wonder if restaurants truly care about their customers' perception of the restaurant.
We'll return, and hopefully, these issues are resolved.
Had a wonderful evening after our broadway show at Barra Rossa.
The service was fantastic, menu options are many/varied, and the pricing was reasonable.
The atmosphere was cozy and intimate and they had a lovely live jazz band playing on a Sat night, absolutely set the tone.
Would recommend 10/10
Don't waste your money.
Soup was about 6 spoon fulls.
The steak salad was a joke for $26.
There was a mother walking up and down with her young son.
He was all over the place.
I gave 2 stars because the place looks nice.
The soup tasted good.
Our waitress was good.
Do not park next door.
The machines to get out shut down, and trapped me and 8 other cars in for over an hour.
Overall, enjoyed the dinner here.
Appetizer came out in large portions.
Bruchetta was very good and calamari was above average.
I got the salmon for the main course and partner got the lobster scampi.
Salmon tasted bland and dry.
It came on top of a strangely tasting risotto with shrimp.
Lobster scampi was definitely the better of the two.
Came with a rich sauce and well made pasta.
Atmosphere was great, staff were friendly, and felt like a comfortably fancy spot.
It's just that the food wasn't to the quality of the prices.
Would hesitate to come back if someone suggested to come here.
Recommend : chicken rice, roti, Char kway teow (noodle dish) Good : hainanese chicken Ok: house special squid  The roti was light and delicious  Squid had dried shrimps in the sauce which was not for me but otherwise was ok.
Overall we enjoyed and food was quite good.
The staff isn't particularly attentive, we had to flag people down for items not delivered to the table, and even failed to do so for more tea and ended up giving up on it and just getting the check.
A good place to try Malaysian cuisine in Philadelphia.
We went over a weekend and was seated in 10 minutes.
The seating is a bit cramped and could use a bit more of lightning inside.
The food was good in terms of flavor, definitely recommend their Canai Roti.
We also tried the veg spring rolls and chicken dumplings for appetizers.
Ordered their mixed veg singaporean noodles, chicken fried rice and chicken sizzler.
The chicken sizzler was flavored very well with black pepper and suggest to give it a try!
This was a good experience l. The food was good and the service was on point although it was a bit late n the crowded side.
It was hard to hear the folks who were with me at my table but overall a good place.
Delicious, flavorful and comforting Malaysian food.
Service was fast.
Started with the roti canai (forgot to take a pic) and shrimp puff.
I had the Hainese chicken with chicken rice and my neice has the beef randang.
Place filled up fast after we arrived but they have a good flow.
Street parking is hard but many parking lots around
One of the best meals I've had here in Chinatown.
Some of the menu items are standard things you'll find in any Chinese restaurant.
We just asked our server to make recommendations and we were blown away by the curries and traditional Malay dishes.
10/10 recommended.
Review for Brunch only.
The selection of food, quality of each dish, service and friendliness of the chef were impeccable.
Nothing bad here at all.
The meal felt exceptionally relaxed.
The servers were attentive without being overbearing (a hard balance which was perfectly executed).
The sizes of each dish were perfect for allowing a taste of everything.
The staff were proactive in making sure every option was always available.
The chef in the kitchen was great explaining it each of the roast dishes available and was very friendly.
The quality of the coffee is a good way to judge a brunch, and the coffee was great.
An exceptional experience.
Note: Review does not apply to afternoon tea (my experience of afternoon tea here over a decade ago was poor, I still have yet to find a place outside of the UK that can provide even an average afternoon tea).
We visited Lacroix for our 2023 Thanksgiving dinner and had a fantastic time.
It was a buffet format and while the price tag was high, the experience was definitely worth it.
The tons of food options were all tasty, including turkey, shrimp, oysters, and more.
Also the pork ribs were outstanding.
Drinks were not included but the wine we ordered was exceptional.
Overall we had a great Thanksgiving meal and would do it again for sure.
We ate here during our stay at the Rittenhouse and overall the restaurant was fine.
When we came here for breakfast on Thanksgiving day, the service was incredibly slow which was really disappointing.
It took forever for us to get our food and when it came out, it wasn‚Äôt even hot.
When we came the next day, it was much faster and better.
Omelettes, croissants, and egg dishes were overall good.
Not much to complain about besides the slow service.
This restaurant was average for me.
The food was very good.
However, I felt the servers were sub-par for a restaurant of this caliber.
The service was very slow after we were seated.
The female server brought us a bottle of wine we order that was spoiled.
She said that it tasted fine to her.
I have tasted thousands of bottles of wine and know good and bad wine.
I do NOT like the fact that they open the bottle at another location than the table.
Opening the wine is part of the process.
When we walked into the restaurant there was a wait for anyone to appear.
And when he did, it felt like they were not expecting anyone to show.
I feel like this place is a want to be top Philly restaurant, but they won't spend the money to get it there.
I would skip this place for the much better options in the square.
They should walk down the Barkley Prime to see how it's done.
My wife and I went for dinner and had a great time.
The food is tasty, the service is great, and the atmosphere is on point.
The only downside is portion size, however quality of the food, along with rarity of the dishes on the menu makes Lacroix stand out.
This place is in a kind of an awkward area but it is SO WORTH IT!
The food is really good!
They sometimes are running a bit behind on orders during lunch time, but that just means they're delicious and everyone is ordering!
My whole office loves this food, we all definitely recommend it!
They also package it very nicely and give us a big box to help carry it all, which is nice!
The waitress was Rude asked for pork fried rice on the combo made a big deal about it I loved this place been going for over 49 years,  but the cleanliness in that dining room was just beyond nasty.
Do they even sweep and mop?
The grime on the doors and walls I did not enjoy my food just thinking of the cleanliness?
This is hands down the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.
I don't live in AZ but when I'm back I will be ordering again.
I reccomend the Walnut Chicken and Beef and Broccoli.
Both were amazing.
Still one of the best places in Phoenix for Chinese Food.
Well, I've been asking my husband to take me here for a couple years now, and he finally did.
I was very dissapointed, as the ownership has changed.
We entered through the back which leads through the kitchen, welcomed by the cooks.
I wonder if it's ever been inspected, if so he must have been blind.
Dark and dirty.
Then passing through you enter into the dinning room.
It is fairly tidy, with no ambiance at all.
It does have oldies music playing which is cool.
One employee that brings you the menu acts like he is really bothered to be there, not polite at all.
After ordering, the food was served by another man whom was a bit more polite, but english very poor, couldn't understand him.
Food was hot, looked apealing, but taste wasn't there.
Ordered shrimp fooyoung, bland dark sauce covering it, portion was large.
Also ordered sweet and sour pork, which was crispy, and served alone, no vegetables or pineapple, sauce weak and served in a bowl, along with rice.
I ordered lomein noodles with chicken, they were fair, and a large portion.
I knew how the place looked from being there years ago, so I took the chance.
Sorry to sayI will not be back.
I ate breakfast at Crazy Jim's quite early in the morning and it was very tasty.
It was not completely out of the way, but I did have to drive in the region of the courthouse.
I had a decent time to spend, as I was awaiting possible jury duty.
The food overall was quite good!
I had a Hiro Omelet.
It does offer Mediterranean/American cuisine.
The omelet was exceptional, and I would return by myself, although I would " think twice" about bringing my wife, and my sons here.
There is a great deal of construction around this area, and I was present at quite an early hour.
Again, the food was exceptional, although the three other words that would describe it well, and which I recall well were: high rises, construction, and a shady crowd surrounding the restaurant.
Sadly, that simply is not something that one can always control.
I'd eat here again, yet keep your eyes open and your wits about you.
Quite possibly, the crowd changes as the hours progress.
The slice of pepperoni pizza was pretty bland.
The carrot cake though was delicious.
Perfect amount of sweetness!
Pizza I would give 3 Stars.
The carrot cake and the service and atmosphere were 4 stars.
I ordered from Grub Hub today for the first time ever because I saw Crazy Jims pop up.
I have been missing it so much since 15th Ave closed.
Received my food and have to say I was disappointed.
They put the pasta salad in with my steak pita and made it inedible.
It was sitting in a pile of oil from the pasta salad.
It should have been packaged seperately for sure.
The pita was ok (I ordered an extra) but definitely not the homemade ones I was used to.
They are just reheated store bought ones.
Bleh.
Food was ok minus the gross oily pita.
For 30.00 I just had higher hopes for this location I guess.
When you‚Äôre in Phoenix with your friend Jim, you have no choice but to eat at Crazy Jim‚Äôs!
The food was great!
The service was awesome!
The staff was very friendly and attentive.
Next time I‚Äôm in Phoenix I‚Äôll definitely be eating here again.
I think this is my first time here or at least in a very long time.
It was pretty busy for lunch but we were seated and served right away.
Enjoyed the salad with a pita and they enjoyed pitas with a side salad.
All good, healthy and reasonably priced.
Super cute place.
Staff very friendly.
Food is delicious!
If you like iced coffee you should definitely try the thai iced coffee with coconut milk!
!
The ambience and the staff are really nice!
The food options are good, but the portions are just big enough for one person!
We tried the Thai Red Curry, Thai Green Curry, and Potstickers!
All of them were good!
Worth trying!
‚úåüèª
Quite tasty Thai food with a sauce slightly on the sweet side.
The tea was perfect.
What  stands out, however, is the service.
The manager saw me struggling to hold my book up as I ate and he brought over a stand.
Truly unique service in this modern world.
Perfect!!!!
I had the drunken noodles and my partner had the yellow curry.
Both dishes were super tasty.
We also enjoyed the spice level but we love spice!
Such an amazing spot downtown!
The atmosphere is very nice, workers are awesome and the food is even better!
My favorite dish is the pineapple shrimp fried rice one of the specialties,  highly recommended.
I love this restaurant!
We had a New Years Eve reservation, and they accommodated our request to sit next to each other.
So we had a 4-top table for two people on a busy night like New Years.
We can't say thank you enough.
The food was outstanding!
Our server took his time to explain the menu and make suggestions to enhance our experience.
The cocktails were delicious and unique!
We had a wonderful night, and I can't wait to return!
I completely loved my brunch here this morning!
We chose Chico Malo as a last minute spot and it was the best thing we could have chosen.
The Guac was amazing and the Shrimp and Grits were so good.
My daughter ordered the French Toast and we‚Äôd come back for just it alone.
Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!
We had a great time here!
The good was so flavorful.
Everyone was really satisfied with their entrees.
The cocktails were yummy and cute.
I had the charred cauliflower and we split the trio.
Really beautiful restaurant and elevated experience.
I would definitely come here again.
Amazing dining experience.
The babe brought me to celebrate Valentines.
Absolutely beautiful restaurant, outstanding service, and delicious food!
Must check it out!
We had an amazing time at Chico Malo.
Food and ambience were terrific .
We ordered cocktails  , chips , entree and dessert.
Cocktails - we ordered Mojavita and ‚ÄúDead men tell no tales‚Äù .
Mojavita was very similar to a margarita but less sweeter.
The second cocktail came with some theatrics.
Chips - it came with a salsa which had a smoky flavor.
We liked it.
Entrees - we had the pork verde which was recommended by our server.
It was a big portion.
It came with a green sauce which was flavorful.
The second entree was very good.
Dessert - our server also recommended the dessert .
It was like a Mexican inspired Twinkie .
Very satisfying.
Overall experience was excellent.
Very calm chill restaurant, i honestly really liked my food & it got me so full!
Servers & everyone was very welcoming & they were on top of everything.
Definitely recommend
Came here before a diamondbacks game at nearby Chase Field.
Staff were friendly and attentive.
They checked on us routinely to ensure the food was up to our expectations and drinks were filled.
It would be ideal for a date night meal.
If you get the right seat you can look out the windows and see the streets and downtown buildings.
There is outdoor seating that is ideal for dinnertime dining.
It would be shaded during the late afternoon/ sunset hours.
The main entrance is on the 2nd floor off the building but there is stair, elevator and escalator access.
The appetizers were great.
Recommend the lobster bisque soup and the tuna.
There's also a great wedge salad.
Such a beautiful experience!
Came here on recommendation from a friend for a date night and was NOT Disappointed!!
Stephanie provided such fun, inviting service and really added to the already enjoyable atmosphere.
The restaurant is beautiful.
The food!!
I can‚Äôt wait to come back several times just to try all the things I spotted on their menu.
We certainly put a dent in that bucket list and my hubby personally tipped the chef because his pasta sauce was that on point!
I can‚Äôt say enough about this restaurant, just go!
You‚Äôll be happy you did!
Outstanding Italian restaurant in downtown Phoenix!
Wait staff and hostesses were all very friendly and accommodating.
The food is very good!
Good mix of pastas, seafood, and steaks.
Large wine and cocktail menu.
Good views of the city.
They have indoor and outdoor seating.
No complaints here.
If you want good Italian food, this is your place.
Highly recommend.
It was a rainy and cold night and they could have started the gas burners earlier.
Food took a while to be served.
But food portions and the steak was great !
The appetizers were all so good, I forgot to take photos.
Food tasted amazing.
I could see why there was a 90 minute wait on a Friday.
Definitely get the meatballs as an appetizer.
They were irresistibly delicious.
The pizza is on lighter cooked side, which I love, but for those who like it crispy, you should ask.
Servers sections seemed all over the place and hard to keep everyone on pace.
They did a great job otherwise.
Visiting the area on a work trip and was in the mood for pizza.
So glad I found Pomo!!!
The pizza was fantastic!!!
I also got some gelato, and it was fabulous!
I wasn't drinking but sat at the bar and had wonderful service.
Has both indoor and outdoor seating.
Highly recommend Pomo!!
!
One of my all time favorites.
Be warned if you get something with the buffalo mozzarella it will be somewhat watery, this is actually not a big it's a feature.
At first I didn't like it but then I couldn't stop thinking about their pizza so I came back.
Now it's one of my favorites.
Really good gelato there too!
Seriously just go try it.
Very nice experience at Pomo.
Our server was attentive and polite, the food was delicious (a little bit expensive) and the restaurante itself is pretty and clean.
Would recommend for some pasta or pizzas.
Best Napoli pizza I had in the US.
Felt like being in Italy.
The drinks are amazing.
Great Expresso Martini.
The staff is the best.
Highly recommend this place
Happening place!
High hopes for the food from the pictures and reviews.
The spinach dip was delicious and flavorful.
The prime rib French dip looked good but was bland and over cooked.
The brussel sprouts and squash were incredible.
The fish and chips were soggy with grease.
Service was good but, not great...he wasn't around a lot but, maybe he was stretched thin.
Atmosphere is very loud but the booth was very comfortable.
This is a great place to check out in the heart of downtown Phoenix.
Even on a weeknight it was busy but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for an outside table.
There is a good selection of steaks as well as fish and a variety of starters.
This fish (sea bass special) was cooked just right and the sides were delicious.
Service was great and very helpful in making recommendations.
Within walking distance of several of the downtown hotels for a nice evening walk before and after.
We went here for early dinner after being at the heard museum.
The food and service was great!
Cool vibes and delicious food.
We ordered the prime rib French dip, the jambalaya and the crispy chicken, which was recommended by the lovely server, it was all so tasty!
A bit pricey but definitely worth it.
Shout out to our server for being so attentive!
Excellent customer service
Nice place, reservations are recommended,  good wine selection.
The jambalaya was good, if you're hungry it has the right size.
The slow roasted prime rib is just delicious one of the best I've tried.
The New York strip won't let you down neither.
My less favorite was the Pacific sea bass, not bad but in here you definitely need to go for a steak.
Atmosphere is great!
Perfect place to grab a drink and some appetizers.
Overall the food is good but not amazing.
It might just be me but most dishes are a bit over seasoned
Great, family owned, amazing food and the owners are always very friendly and involved with their community ‚ù§Ô∏è
They have the BEST beans and rice!
And meat is soft, sauce is flavorful and amazing, service is incredibly awesome.
I definitely come back when i visit Phoenix!!!
!
El Portal Mexican Food Restaurant is a culinary gem that never disappoints!
From the moment you step through the door, the vibrant atmosphere and welcoming staff create an inviting experience.
The menu is a tantalizing array of authentic Mexican dishes, each bursting with robust flavors.
Whether you're a fan of mouthwatering tacos or their signature enchiladas, El Portal delivers a taste sensation that transports you to the heart of Mexico.
The service is exceptional ‚Äì friendly, attentive, and passionate about ensuring your dining experience is top-notch.
The attention to detail in both presentation and taste is evident, making every visit a true delight.
El Portal is not just a restaurant; it's a celebration of Mexican cuisine.
If you're craving genuine flavors and a festive ambiance, look no further.
This place has earned its spot as my go-to Mexican food haven!
¬°Delicioso!
Thanks, Mary Rose and Earl
I really enjoyed the red chili and egg for breakfast.
It was so good.
The inside of the restaurant has beautiful murals, and a great place to eat with friends, or hold a meeting.
I hope I come back soon.
I like this place because it has a very cozie ambience to it.
No matter which Mexican restaurant I go to, flautas are the first thing I will try.
The rice and beans are great but the beef flautas were very dry and not too flavourful.
I will go back but next time I'll try the chicken.
Small little Mexican restaurant inside of San Carlos Hotel.
We stopped by for a nightcap and we're not disappointed the owner was very helpful and attentive and we always felt at home.
We tried the potato taquitos and the pozole rojo and they were both exceptional.
We also tried some of their cocktails and those are very savory as well.
The location is pretty tiny indoors however they do have some seating outside.
They don't have restrooms you have to borrow a card key and go to the hotels restroom right outside of the restaurant.
The owner mentioned that they are moving into another location pretty soon with more space.
Husband and I went here and it was so good, loved the atmosphere.
our server Bri was amazing and the food came out quick and hot.
we will most certainly be back.
Queso fundido was DELICIOUS!
Definitely would go back to try again.
Enchiladas were good as well as the tacos, expected a little more but they were fine.
Very small place!
Good food and service.
We sat on the patio, ordered a drink, an appetizer, and two dishes.
All food were good.
It was a lovely evening to sit on the sidewalk, eating and observing the street and traffic.
The burrito was big and taste good.
The taco was mini, small r than I though, but they came in 5 tacos.
They taste very good.
The fish was crispy and the sauce was yummy.
I got rice and bean on the side.
They were good too.
Margarita drink was lovely.
My Favorite restaurant in Phoenix!
Amazing food!
Carna Asada Taco‚Äôs and their Chicken Enchiladas are my favorite and if you get a chance they have fresh pressed Watermelon Margaritas that are simply the best in the city.
Staff is upbeat and friendly and I love seeing them every time I‚Äôm in town!
This place will not disappoint you!
Stopped by for some Greek fries, and they did not disappoint!
Ended up getting Nick‚Äôs fries with lamb/beef.
The meat was perfect, and it was nice and hot.
The spicy ranch is a bit much for me, so I‚Äôd probably do without it next time.
Still a great option, and I‚Äôll definitely be back with friends and family.
This is a great place for a quick bite to eat when exploring downtown Phoenix.
My gyro was stuffed with meat and everything was delicious.
Come check it out!
Love that a Greek restaurant plays Greek music.
Creates a great atmosphere.
Been here before and enjoyed the food.
Today I stopped by for a dessert.
First time trying loukoumades; it was warm, a great amount, and overall tastes great!
Overall I liked my meal.
I got a beef gyro combo meal with the Greek fries.
While it was tasty, I would have liked more sauce/flavor with the gyro.
The fries were good, though not crispy.
Having paid about $18 for this combo meal, I would have liked a little more flavor in the gyro, and crispy fries.
Nice place to grab a gyro before a comedy show or game.
Located right in the middle of the center can walk to and go downtown.
Where should I start?
Dinner date with my wife and she picked to eat here.
It was actually the first time either of us has been here.
Cibo did not disappoint.
It is Thursday night, but we were seated almost immediately.
Our server Jamey was great.
Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more attentive and knowledgeable server.
Food was great, it‚Äôs hard to describe the flavors, but I think it‚Äôs a place you need to try yourself.
First thing you notice is the vibe.
Immediately disarmed by how calm and relaxed the environment they have created for you.
It's down to the small details.
Not overly done.
Bravo.
The service was impressive, even as full as they were, wine and appetizers were served rather quickly.
The gentleman that helped us, was an absolute legend.
He was fantastic!!!
Thank you very much Richie, you're an absolute ripper mate!!!!
Now, the main event.
The food.
It has been a while since I've enjoyed a very well seasoned, properly proportioned meal.
The crust on our pizza and calzone, was superb.
The suggestions were on point.
We will absolutely be coming back.
If you are looking for a new place to relax, have a brilliant meal and some rather lively musical accompaniment, this is the best place I've found in the states.
My complements to the Chef.
It was an absolute delight.
Bravo!
Bravo!
This is an amazing restaurant!
This hidden little gym in downtown Phoenix is a quaint little Italian joint that has some of the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix.
They have very good pizza the meatball sandwiches or just meatballs on their own are just amazing!
No matter what you get you will enjoy it but definitely try the meatballs even if you weren't thinking about it!
I've been to this restaurant two times now and they were spot on both times once in the evening for dinner when they're a very busy and they had great service and today for lunch and they weren't very busy and still had excellent service.
Do yourself a favor and try this restaurant you will not be disappointed.
Beautiful restaurant with indoor and outdoor space.
The outdoor space is perfect for winter weather as heaters are available for guests.
I really enjoy their pizza and calamari.
The pizza dough is bouncy in a good way.
Calamari was crispy and well seasoned.
I personally not enjoy their Saltimbocca Caldi that much.
The Polpette meatball one was a bit dried and Alla Parmigiana texture was a bit weird.
Pizza is by far really really good - the pear salad was quite delicious.
Whether it‚Äôs a date night or celebrating a birthday- it‚Äôs a great place.
I‚Äôd recommend making a reservation üëçüèº.
I discovered Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe while in town for a conference.
A coworker spotted it while exploring, and after reading Mrs. White's story on their website, we we're very excited to go for dinner, even after reading the mixed reviews.
We had a great experience.
The service was terrific and the food was great.
The building is old and run down, but isn't that what makes a place qualify as a hole in the wall?
It has its charms and what it lacks in atmosphere it far makes up for in people and soul food.
Give this place a chance!
The price for the meal is outrageous.
$23 for a small smothered pork chop and 2, 1/2 - 2/3 cup size sides.
I eat out 75% of my meals.
The price should be $14-$16 only because it‚Äôs an iconic Phoenix restaurant.
Or keep it $23 but double the amount of everything.
I had to eat another lunch 3 hours later.
I‚Äôve been coming to Mrs Whites since 1991.
My last visit was in Oct of 2023 and the prices were $18 ish for the same meal.
Food taste was great as usual (pc and cabbage and green beans and potatoes).
Service was also great but it was only 1/4 filled at noon.
Please don‚Äôt go out of business because of over pricing.
Perhaps keep reading these reviews.
I was a little nervous at first when we got there.
Due to the appearance of the building.
But once we got inside, the vibe was totally totally cool.
The food was amazing.
The service was even greater, so we really enjoyed our experience.
We will definitely be back again!
Went for our first time before a baseball game.
Only issue was having to wait for some of our food.
But they were busy so we understood.
It was worth it!
Everything was absolutely delicious and home-cooked for sure!
We arrived at 1:31.
We immediately were seated and waited about 30 minutes for our order to be taken and another 45 minutes for our food to be brought to us.
For a total of one hour and 15 minutes that we waited to eat.
We were missing two pieces of chicken, one piece per person.
We weren‚Äôt brought the cornbread that we ordered, and we didnt even bother asking about the dessert that we ordered.
We were told it took so long because they ran out of flour.
Yeah, ya know,  a place that serves fried chicken...They ran out of flour!
We were comped the drinks ($4 each) after my brother-in-law said he'd just pay for the drinks and we'd go.
They told him the flour story and said it'd be 4 more mins.
We had invested so much time at this point we just stayed.
When the food finally did come it was just ok.
The fried chicken tasted like fried chicken.
Wasn't better or worse than any other fried chicken we'd ever had.
The greens tasted like greens, the sweet potato tasted like a sweet potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese tasted like mac & cheese.
My recommendation would be to find somewhere else, especially if you're really hungry going in.
Also the place has way too many tables for the space so you feel really cramped when seated and are constantly getting bumped into.
Quite possibly the best service and atmosphere for a large group of 150+ for a conference hospitality I have ever seen.
Over the top staff, service and the food, woah!
I wish I could give more than 5 stars and we can't wait to come back!
Willie's Taco Joint offers some punchy flavors in their tacos, we walked away full and happy.
Prices weren't low, but weren't outrageous, and weren't surprising as this is a downtown eatery, very close to the baseball stadium.
Service was quick and friendly.
We ate on the patio, enjoying the sun.
It's a colorful taco joint.
Music was a bit crude, not a negative for me, but it's not quite family friendly.
This was such a great place to eat and get drinks right outside of the stadiums.
The food is worth the prices to drinks are very well put together and overall a 10 out of 10.
I even messed up the order by not asking them to not put cheese on my fries and they were so cool about it.
I'm even going to leave them $10 just to help pay for the fries that were wasted because of my mistake.
Very awesome place!
I stopped here before the Diamondbacks game tonight.
I picked out the Green Butcher (award winning) taco and asked the bartender for a suggestion because every other taco sounded great.
She suggested the shrimp taco and it was also very good.
The Green Butcher was probably in my top 5 tacos ($6.50) hands down every bite was delicious and there was a ton of meat on there.
I would score the shrimp taco a solid 3.5/5 the shrimp were the big prawn or tiger sized shrimp, but there were probably only 2 on the small taco.
Taste was good but I preferred the green butcher over the shrimp.
Atmosphere is a 5/5 at least on a game day like today.
It was busy, and hot outside and the misting system really helped keep it pleasant.
Self serve taco restaurant.
Order your food at the counter, pay, and wait for your name to be called.
We visited early in the day before the game, so the place was quite empty.
But I can see this place being packed.
The servers seem to know their regular customers.
They talked and laughed a lot.
The food was very good.
We had Green Butcher (pork taco) and a glass of margarita on the rock.
At the sauce bar, you can find both mild and spicy sauce.
$1.69 for chips and salsa and very friendly and great customer service!
The best burritos in Phoenix!!!
Lol...
I had my food to go so I didn't spend any real time inside but from what I did feel from being there was since of comfort.
It's getting time for a bit of touch up paint but all and all it was not bad and when I got to my destination the food was still warm and tasty.
Thanks for a good meal and keep up the good work.
I would like to take this opportunity and give acknowledgment to one of the servers at La Canasta.
We had a very lovely meal and our server was absolutely wonderful her name is Melissa.
She was very cordial, polite and constantly asked if we needed anything else.
I thought that was so wonderful.
I really think she deserves recognition for her outstanding service for La Canasta Restaurant.
Thank you for hiring such a good employee.
Jennifer took my order for pickup and let me tell you, she was the most pleasurable person to speak with over the phone.
It's nice to know, even when they were busy that she still was taking care of me while most likely under pressure.
I ordered the chimi lunch special.
Definitely, would recommend.
Thank you for the great food and outstanding customer service.
It's never a long wait for ordering pick up.
FYI
I grew up going here for family events the place was always crowded and the service and food was always amazing.
I ordered enchilida's  no clue why I did because I am super picky when it comes to those.
I did not like them however I do no feel that is their fault.
I ordered something I have a hard time liking.
I did look upset the whole time at the end The owners daughter or she might own it now I believe , offered me something free to go home with she said she noticed I didn't like my food.
I loved the beans and everything else.
However the reason why I was upset was we were looking for the hostess stand because there used to be one.
We were talking about the change.
I noticed a younger couple pointing at me laughing.
whispering back and fourth and looking at me.
My guess is I was being fat ashamed because I went to the restroom to try and see why they were laughing at me checked my hair and make up anything someone could find funny but I found nothing.
I was depressed the rest of the meal and even struggled not to cry, I went from 102 lbs to 200 now after I had my son.
So the weight gain is hard on me.
So to feel judged over my weight in such a way hurt, to be pointed and laughed at.
The ordering at the counter was odd.
the extra charge for the chips and salsa threw me off.
I missed the old family atmosphere this place had.
However the Owners are still kind people.
To the people complaining about it being dirty the its not dirty this place is old as dirt most likely just needs a makeover.
The food is still amazing.
The staff is still friendly.
Id give it 5 stars if it wasn't for me not liking the new counter ordering and extra charge on chips and salsa.
Great food and great people.
The staff are incredibly friendly, like to hold conversations, and are very funny.
Nick L. is one of the best workers there too.
He‚Äôs fast and efficient, and definitely a great employee.
The food is made with care, it‚Äôs not sloppy and is overall a good casual dining place.
It is conveniently located in the heart of downtown.
The restrooms are very clean and always smell fine.
The soda selection is huge and the cup sizes are perfect.
I rarely eat at Five Guys.
I think they make good burgers, the fries are better than many fast food restaurants but their prices are too high for what you get.
I had their Double Cheeseburger and a large fry.
I also had the free peanuts for the first time, I liked them.
The burger was very good.
The large fries come in a tiny cup, the size of an order of small fries from McDonald's.
They dump a large fries worth of fries into the bag on top of your food.
It's all a marketing move that makes it look as if you have an over abundance of fries.
It didn't work.
You get a large fries worth of fries.
We're basically over paying for a Dave's Double and large fries.
If prices were the same I would choose 5 Guys over Wendy's.
With the significant increase in price over Wendy's the difference isn't worth the money.
Give 5 Guys a try, I think the food is definitely delicious.
It's with the price I have issue.
This is my first time at Five Guys.
The cheeseburger is unbelievably tasty.
I was not aware that they made the burgers to order, and they even got it right!
My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger.
And I got the vienna hot dog with the works.
And all in all it was very good the meat was fresh and tasty.
It was fast, easy, and delicious.
Oh yeah, and the french fries were okay.
Solid location for downtown Phoenix, accesible for that matter.
Friendly staff.
Burgers just didn‚Äôt impress me overall though, need a little extra love on those patties.
It was good.
Pricey I thought but every breakfast place has gone up crazy prices lately.
Hard to justify not just buying your own eggs and bacon for home.
Nice place, super friendly.
Parking a little inconvenient, not their fault.
Not a lot of variety for the breakfast menu, I was expecting more diner type variety.
But what we got was delicious.
Insane food.
Went here for breakfast everyday.
Home cooked, moreish food that just hit the spot.
Staff were super helpful.
If you come to Phoenix and don‚Äôt eat here, you have rocks in your head.
Amazing service from amazing staff!
I enjoyed my breakfast meal at the location.
This manager (assuming he was it) recognized that I am Deaf and gestured to learn what I would like.
So he added my name to the waiting list.
I was seated within 10 mins.
The place was super busy but the whole staff was great.
I enjoyed the waffle with two pieces of bacon with half avocado as a side.
Good food and vibe.
We went around 9:30-10am and were told it was a 20-25 minute wait.
Fine no problem it was busy.
We got seated in around that length of time.
Staff were helpful and friendly and accommodated our requests (our friends had their baby with them so they Brough a high chair and some chopped banana).
Food took quite some time to come out which I can forgive when a place is busy however we did see some some tables get served before us who were seated after us.
We got our main courses first and ordered another plate to share (waffle and bacon) which we waited over an hour for.
Overall good food staff and atmosphere.
Recommend going around 11am after the morning rush has died down a bit.
I ordered the big papa burrito and it was very good.
The fam came in for brunch and had a fantabulous meal!
I ordered the five spot, the hubby had the daily special and the kiddos shared the hog and chick.
Haley was incredibly sweet, patient and engaging with the kiddos.
The place was extremely busy and she always had a smile on her face, a courteous response and a professional attitude.
The whole serving team seems to work together and take care of each other, so that the diners experience the best service possible.
It did not go unnoticed.
We definitely recommend and plan on going back.
Thank you!
!
very good!!
everything was fresh and filling.
i had combo #3 2 shredded beef crunchy tacos with rice and beans my husband had combo #8 green chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans and we also ordered 2 beef red chili tamales enchilada style ü§§ we took home some conchas and empanadas üëåüëå
Came here to check out the concha and a few tacos.
Had xl concha and I was lucky enough to a have a freshly made one take one home.
It was fun to experience but it definitely lacked the sweetness that is consistent in the original size.
When I thought carne I expected a street taco style but it was crispy taco style which I thought is better for shredded beef/chicken.
The asada lacked much flavor.
All in all - I‚Äôd stay stick with shredded beef/chicken taco combo plate.
And the pan dulce to go üëçüèº
The XL conchas is what brought us here & caught our attention.
Make sure you pre-order a day before for the XL conchas, we didn't know this.
They have a panaderia with a good variety of pan dulce.
The restaurant serves Mexican dishes for breakfast & lunch.
Pictured is menudo & Carne asada torta.
Chocolate abuelita is really good.
Place gets pretty packed but, line moves quickly.
Everyone is really nice.
The waiter was able to score us an XL concha so that was nice.
Found this location on Instagram.
Hyped way up.
First the service was horrible.
Was greeted by server who was sitting down.
No smiles from any of the staff or welcoming demeanor.
Second, food isn‚Äôt anything different than Macayo‚Äôs or Mixteca.
Pan Dulce options were sparse.
Don‚Äôt go out of your way to try it.
Food was not good.
Menudo was bland, The Mauros special was just filled with mostly potatoes, I couldn‚Äôt even taste no chicken.
The only good thing was the tortillas.
Definitely overhyped -
Great casual place, stopped by early for breakfast instead of late.
Enjoyed the egg salad tartine - will have to try with bacon the next time!
Order at the bar but table service provided.
We came here around 1pm on a Saturday.
The place was around half full with a short line to the counter where you order your food.
After you order and pay, they give you a number to bring to your table and they will bring the items out.
They have some tables in a loft area on the second floor as well!
Service was great and very friendly.
After bringing our coffees I asked where I could get cream and instead of just pointing to where, the server went and got sugar and cream for us.
My wife and I got egg dishes that were both delicious.
My daughter had an English muffin with jelly.
Prices were good and the coffee was great!
They also have 2 hours of free parking in the garage with validation, sweet!
The burger was really good.
Great flavor.
Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars for me is because I absolutely love French fries.
And especially with my burger.
This place doesn't have them as a side for your burger.
That's it.
Otherwise, it was delicious.
This place was amazing , small portions, great staff and friendly- Thank you to Shannon at the front holding it down when it was busy and Shea for serving us and always having a smile.
We are excited for the Mayo Location to Open
Ordered take out from Ingo's but will say that the atmosphere of the place seems great.
The food came out fast and was well packed.
The staff was very nice.
I liked the food but I wish they had been a little more generous with the salad greens.
We stayed 2 hours to watch the Sun's game at the rainy night.
not many people but the store was warm and cozy.
They have 2 4-screen wall TV that shows the game.
Don't feel too high end like those nearby ones.
Their speed is fast and it's pretty clean.
Right after entering the front door, there's the touch machine that you can customize your order.

Was a pretty good experience one of the few Taco bells that serve alcoholic beverages clean environment and friendly staff as far as the food goes it was hot and tastes like Taco Bell nothing less than what I expected
Weird experience but cool.
Taco Bell is *not* high-end, but it was above-average by Taco Bell standards.
A variety of mixed drink options would have made it a bit more interesting, rather than just choosing which booze I want in my Baja Blast slush.
My husband and I stopped to pick up a "quick" bite after a concert we saw at Chase Field (and there was a basketball game that same night), so we expected it to be busy, but we waited 1 hour for our order of some tacos and burritos.
You could see the staff were working as fast as they could but some of them were doing dual jobs, so that tells me they were short staffed.
You are supposed to get a free taco on Tuesdays if you buy a drink.
They won't wait on you at the register and make you use the kiosk which doesn't give you the free taco.
I waited the register to pay cash and tell her that the kiosk did not honor the free taco and she rang up another taco.
Rather than changing it she simply said that she had already rung it up and that I would know how to use the kiosk next time I come in.
I will never be back and the rude lady at the counter should be reprimanded.
I wish I could tell you her name.

First time eating at El Charro Cafe, and it was fantastic.
The food was excellent and our server treated us like we were royalty.
Recommend El Charro Cafe to anyone who wants a great meal in a wonderful atmosphere.
I really enjoy going to coffee places and this is definitely must try.
Very chill very relaxing the coffee was great.
El Charro...one of our favorite places We go El Charros in Paradise Valley, on Lincoln, with members of our family.
It is always a memorable occasion.
Nesteled at the foot of a mountain, it is steeped, rich in tradition.
Like an old Spanish ranch, with beautiful fountains, fireplaces, and landscaping, Every corner is special, and private, like a beautiful painting.
The food has been top quality, prepared by chefs.
Coffee is rich, mellow, and smooth.
Desserts are, again, chef quality, not to be compared.
Patio dining under the stars is awesome, especially by one of the flickering  fireplaces.
You do pay for this, but all fine things are worth it.
Very good food it's so clean staff is very helpful and responsible
The food was wonderful, the service was the worst!!
Our waiter was non-existent at best.
Five stars for the amazing food and dining experience we had on Christmas.
Our server was awesome and the west coast oysters were delicious and fresh.
Minus two stars for constantly being asked to move our seats during wine hour.
We had received two free wine glasses earlier in the week as platinum members and enjoyed watching sports on the TV.
Next night we went back to our seats we sat in before and they asked us to move to the smaller table as the others were for dining patrons.
So we moved to the other table.
Second person came by and asked us to move entirely.
We said we just moved here and they left.
Third person came by and made us move.
I wouldn‚Äôt care so much except we have my fiance‚Äôs disabled mom with us and she had to keep getting up and down after a long day.
Seating needed to be clear in the beginning.
Sending three people was excessive, and only did the third person tell us where we could sit other than a you-need-to-move.
There were plenty of tables available similar to ours, so it wasn‚Äôt a space issue.
Fantastic ambiance and delicious cuisine.
The service was outstanding.
We opted for the grilled octopus, which was fabulous, and the lobster roll impressed with generous lobster chunks and perfectly seasoned flavors.
Had a table booked for 13 for my birthday here to try something new.
When I called before hand the person on the phone stated they could split the check between people and my waiter told us I was informed wrong, they could split it evenly but not by groups of orders so it kind of made it difficult and they weren‚Äôt very accommodating in finding a solution for that.
The drinks were good, a little overpriced.
The food was big portions though.
Service was not that great.
Lots of orders were late or forgotten and our table was never checked on, so many waters empty and forgotten.
Also a friend asked for a little birthday dessert to sing happy birthday and then our waiter charged us for it.
Never had a restaurant charge for a small birthday dessert, usually its out of courtesy.
So I probably wouldn‚Äôt come back if I had to choose a place to dine for a group at least.
So good, the octopus is wonderfull, you can ejoy a good night with delicious food and good drink or beer, the view is really nicw and ia neaely tu USS navy, so is the perfect location for a special night.
Conveniently located inside the Marriott Marquis, this restaurant is a gem.
With a great brunch (and mimosas), there is an excellent menu for all-day dining with plentiful seating with great views.
La Puerta has a great vibe from the moment you walk in....  Staff is friendly and accommodating!
Our server was attentive and knowledgeable with the menu.
Made sure we didn't order items that we wouldn't like.
Our food choices came out hot and fresh.
Everyone was happy with their choices.
Everything on the menu looked tasty and appealing...  Place was busy with customers at the bar.
Also all the tables were full.
They do have patio seating out front.
La Puerta will not disappoint...
When in San Diego stop by.
I know you'll be happy you did.
Solid Mexican food spot.
Great atmosphere inside, though the table and chairs we sat at need to be rebalanced.
The service was pretty good.
Craft beer list was decent.
Pretty extensive menu.
Ended up just getting a surf and turf 1lb burrito.
Went a step further and got it wet, half red/half green.
It also unexpectedly came with some free ships and salsa.
The burrito was excellent, though I would refrain from getting it wet next time as it was unncessary.
I do think the red/green wetness is just their chip salsa flavors.
Would definitely come back though!
Nice little spot.
Went with a large party of guys.
We squished into a large round booth very uncomfortably.
We all ordered the same spicy margaritas which were very good but also very small.
The food order was brought out very quick and correct.
The food was very good.
The guac tasted fresh.
Overall good experience and good food.
Totally amazing all around!
Do not miss out on coming here!
Ambiance, vibe, food, drinks and service are amazing!
While lotta love was literally the best marg I've ever had!
Everyone was thrilled and we had a large party!
Had the pastor 1lb burrito traditional and some chips and salsa.
The waiter was great, quick to come up and take my order, refill water and salsa.
Had football on and good atmosphere.
Burrito was good almost reminded me of a fajita partially but was great and would eat again.
Curious to spot a unicorn?
Go to pokez where you can enjoy an authentic burrito shop at knows how to do it vegan.
Nothing personal against chipotle, but there is nothing sterile about the food here.
As a burrito lover (snob?)
I‚Äôve ordered multiple of their vegan selections.
They have several to choose from including vegan breakfast, burritos, potato and chorizo, and more.
Last time I had the California burrito which didn‚Äôt suit me.
They use the beyond burger in the burrito which to me tasted like having a hamburger in a burrito.
So this time I ordered the veggie.
It was really good; it came with rice, beans, guac, lettuce, and even vegan cheese!
The burrito is giant and delicious, very umami.
The one thing it was lacking was consistency.
The entire burrito was quite soft and I wish they had a plant-based meat (besides Beyond Meat) to add some substance.
Pokez serves the burrito with a cabbage salad, which was nothing too exciting.
However, I really enjoyed the pur√©ed tomato style salsa with some heat, which I poured over every bite.
For dining in, they do rely on single use cutlery and plates.
I wish everything wasn‚Äôt so  disposable.
The prices here are reasonable‚Äîyou can get a vegan burrito from $9-13.
There are not many places that I would give an authentic burrito rating of 10/10 as a vegan, but Pokez knows how to serve up that giant tortilla-wrapped deliciousness.
The food looked appetizing but the taste was not up to par.
We ordered a potato burrito recommended by the cashier and it was not good.
The overall service/friendliness of the staff was good.
The atmosphere was unique, however there were flies and bugs flying around.
Two Nats flew onto our food while we were eating.
It could be that we ordered the wrong dish but would not recommend the potato burrito.
The place is more about being hipster than actually making good food.
Pretty bland salsas.
I feel like I'm getting a burrito in the Midwest and not San Diego.
Maybe it's good for vegans who have fewer choices and I'm just the wrong audience, even though they have a full meat menu.
The kicker is when you pay by card, the cashier verbally asks you how much of a tip you want to leave.
I'd only ever heard that in Mexico, but it is absolutely cringe worthy.
I feel sorry for them when they ask that.
This place rocks!
Good vegetarian options.
Feels very family style.
Street parking.
GREAT SERVICE!
Beyond Nacho highly recommended.
Vegan & vegetarian options abound at this longstanding gem of a restaurant.
PLUS they carry & sell this outstanding, rare, traditional hot sauce from Guadalajara MX called Abuelita Guille.
‚ô•Ô∏èüî• A rare find!
One of the dopest spots with the most delicious food!
I absolutely loved it.
I got the Baja fish tacos and my daughter got Checking tacos and they were amazing.
The chips and salsa were incredible, but the stars of the show were the nacho fries and watermelon margarita.
DELICIOUS!!!
I'll definitely be back!
From all restaurants in the Gaslamp areas I picked to eat here.
Me and my husband chose to eat outdoor dining because we could hear the music from outside already so it would be too loud for us to be eating in indoor dining plus the weather was not that bad at the time.
Sergio was our waiter and he was really helpful and friendly.
The food that we got was good.
I got myself a ‚Äúla t√≠pica torta‚Äù and the size of the sandwich was little too big for me I wish I knew I would‚Äôve order something else with smaller portions.
My husband he had birria taco.
Overall everything was good.
Rico our server was GREAT!!
The food amazing!!
The cheese fried barria taco was a hit at our table.
We highly recommend the drinks too we had the frozen margarita they have lots of flavors.
Highly recommend this place for lunch / dinner!
My friends had such a great time and friendly staff!!
‚ù§Ô∏è
Female bartender was such a ditz.
She knew nothing about what she was serving, and her reasoning was... she doesn't work Tuesdays, so she has no clue.
She said they don't have a tequila flight (see last pic).
She also said she would have zero idea which tequilas they would be anyway (see last pic...again lol).
Every interaction with her was painful and awkward.
The atmosphere is pretty cool though, I suggest maybe training the people behind the bar a tad better.
The trio of margaritas was decent.
Atmosphere is cool.
Very chill and casual.
Ordered a couple of drinks and the nachos with carne asada added.
The asada was a wet, like it was just beef sitting in a pot.
It was tender but asada has to have a little char on it, this didn‚Äôt.
The cheese was like cheese from a can and covered every chip making it soggy.
They put salad in it.
Salad on nachos.
The pico de gallo was too much and just mixed in with salsa.
It came in a to-go container, no plates.
I have to say these were the worse nachos I‚Äôve ever had, no exaggeration.
I don‚Äôt mind paying a little more for good food, but these were expensive and bad.
Two stars because the bartender was attentive and friendly.
Really great restaurant which actually has spicy food!
The decor is quite nice and the service super quick and friendly.
We had the drunken noodles with seafood which was pretty big and had a good amount of seafood in it which was nice.
For the other dish we did the chicken massaman curry.
First time trying this dish anywhere and it was fantastic.
The curry, coconut and mix of peanuts was delicious.
This dish was definitely spicier than the drunken noodles.
We had ordered this one as level 6 and the noodles 9 however this one proved to be spicier somehow.
We both enjoy spicy food so it wasn't a problem for us.
Would definitely go back if we were in the area again.
Terrific service!
Fast, attentive and hospitable.
The  food was excellent.
The Honey Duck was cooked to perfection, rich in flavor and crispy!
It was quiet and relaxing even though they were pretty busy.
I‚Äôd definitely eat here again.
FYI for plant-based folks: Sab Lai Thai Kitchen has a notable number of vegan and vegetarian dishes if you‚Äôre on a plant-based diet.
I tried the drunken noodles with chicken.
It took about 20 minutes for me to receive my food.
The restaurant was busy and packed on a Monday evening.
They had no seating indoors, so I was seated outside on a bar stool facing the streets.
The food was spicy, but not unbearably spicy and it was flavorful with the basil.
Since I was dining solo, I had eaten about half of the plate and asked for the rest to be packed to go.
The staff were nice and checked to make sure I had utensils when I was packing my leftovers to go.
I personally won't be returning since I experienced an allergic reaction with outbreak of hives.
Love it!
If you are looking for Thai food in San Diego, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place in the Gaslamp district.
We ordered mixed vegetables, green curry and Tom yum soup.
Everything tasted good and Green Curry was amazing!
Love it.
Portion size was good.
Hot soups are highly recommended.
We ate lunch today and enjoyed it.
Staff are polite with nice smiles.
Food tastes were authentic, and it's located in the historic heart of San Diego, so the location is perfect.
Try if you like thai food.
The service wasn't very good, they just took a long time to acknowledge and attend to us.
The food was great!
We had the turkey sandwich and it was amazing!
We were visiting from Colorado Springs for Christmas and I would still recommend this place.
Avocado toast is amazing.
Tomorrow is going to be our last day in San Diego and it's going to be hard to choose which breakfast to enjoy for our last day, but it's between the mission and another place.
Coffee is above average.
I had the baked French toast and it was amazing.
It was like bread pudding but waaay better.
I can't wait to go back and try more.
A great breakfast stop in San Diego.
Had a great mix of traditional American breakfast options, fresh/healthy food, and Mexican influence (so basically San Diego ha).
Delicious, ordered the chicken apple sausage frittata, can't wait to visit again to try more items on their menu.
Orange juice was delicious as well.
!8, big San Diego Foodie I‚Äôve been to Hodad‚Äôs twice, and I‚Äôve yet to be disappointed.
Food: I always get a double cheeseburger, and an order of half onion rings-half fries Double cheeseburger: I always get extra lettuce, and end up taking my tomatoes out.
THEY DO NOT RATION!
For 15 dollars, it is a nice, juicy, fat, burger.
I‚Äôve had friends struggle on the portion sizes.
Pickles are the best, they‚Äôre hefty slices Fries: fries are shaped like wedges, but they‚Äôre infinite times better than wedges.
They‚Äôre extremely hot and crispy, with a mashed potatoes-like center, lots of fries Onion rings: they use real onions, extremely crispy, lots of onion rings They‚Äôre ranch is good too, it tastes like ranch.
One cup each person, unless if you ask for more but they fill it up nicely  Service: Average service, but the food is so good that it gets a 4 out of 5  Atmosphere: pretty dope, diner-like vibe.
They have their stickers everywhere, and they give you one each person, when you pay.
All different types of seating areas; booths, high tables, long table bench-picnic-type of table, in the center of the restaurant.
I‚Äôve only ever been for school lunches, so like 12-2 pm, on weekdays, so there‚Äôs never really more than like 15 people, whenever I go.
Them having the napkin dispenser, and two bottles of hot sauce at the tables, is also super nice.
Great place for a big bite!
I ordered a cheese burger with cheddar and all the toppings and it was great.
Fries were great and potato-y.
I tried the onion rings and wasn‚Äôt a huge fan so if you are trying to decide, go with the fries (they are also less expensive).
The decor is very fun and music is fitting for the atmosphere.
They have a sign saying they don‚Äôt split bills for more than 4 guests and there is a 3% added service fee.
Cute, grungy atmosphere.
Super nice server, Josue (sorry if that‚Äôs spelled wrong)!
My mini bacon cheeseburger was huge!
Chocolate shake also huge!
And we ordered the Frings, a basket overflowing with fries and onion rings.
Good food and great service, we‚Äôll definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in the area.
When you think of Americans burgers, you think of Hodad‚Äôs!!!
Gigantic burgers (don‚Äôt worry you can choose between S, M or L ahah) and very tasty!
Nice server.
Sides are an extra - that you don‚Äôt particularly need because of burgers size, or that you should maybe share.
Great interior!
loved the decor.
They‚Äôll eventually give you a sticker at the end, great souvenir
The service was great and the burgers were excellent.
It's easy to see why Hodad's has such a great reputation for their burgers.
They are a must for burger lovers who visit San Diego.
I would give it five stars, but the location is not great in my opinion.
The Hodad's Ocean Beach is definitely in the better location.
However, I don't want disuade anyone from going to Hodad's Downtown because it's definitely a unique experience everyone should try at least once.
Great fun.
Waited 20+ mins at drive thru for our order to be filled.
We were the only ones in line, restaurant fairly empty.
Not a big order, about 12 items tops for the four of us.
Attendant asks us to park the car while they work on the order.
Fine.
Random woman comes to car window to ask for 5 bucks, gets extremely hostile when I decline (if i give a fiver to one i'm gonna have to give a fiver to all, right?).
We continue to wait a loooooong time -- the one who needs the fiver takes full advantage of this, making random trips to our car to communicate how much she doesn't like me.
Finally drive-thru person tells us she's ready to give us our order.
We swing around, but for some reason she's actually not ready.
She's still slowly putting things in the bag then starts furiously trying to secure the bag.
We beg her to just let us take the bag and leave cause we're starving and we're on the way to the waterfront to try to catch the sunset before it drops entirely.
Nope, she keeps working on it.
Now when I say secure the bag, my meaning here is literally she is winding industrial strength tape all up and down the sides and over the top of the bag.
After 5 mins of this she passes the bag over.
Getting the bag in our hands makes all of us feel a bit better.
I try to peek in to check contents against the order, but realize we're kind of stymied by all the tape.
The paper bag is also industrial strength, impressively so, and with all the tape we realize we can't get in without making a mess or taking another 15 mins to pick at it and pull it off.
So we trust that the 20+ mins they took was sufficient for them to get everything we ordered into the bag.
Off to the sunset!!
Not sure where we actually went but it was nice, lots of hotels looking out over the water, shops, and big rocks against the waterside, and stretches of green grass behind with folks and dogs prancing.
Still a little sun left.
We find a nice spot and then all of us start furiously picking and pulling at the tape to get at our dinner.
Now I've been living in Japan for awhile and they don't have JIB there.
So this was a first for 3 of us and we learn that JIB is very tasty.
And we are really enjoying the experience -- I mean really enjoying.
We are eating our burgers and fries and watching the sunset and the party boat and dogs and kites.
And then my son, fries eaten and ready for his burger, roots around at the bottom of the big bag and pulls out one of the most pathetic things I have ever seen any restaurant produce: 2 circular cheese-covered and very dried hamburger slices wedged between 2 leaves of lettuce, carefully assembled and placed into some folded paper to hold it.
LOL, gotta hand it to you JIB, you got us pretty good!!
No bun, clever!!
Made sure we didn't notice at the drive-thru so we'd get the full effect of your prank.
Well done!
!
The food is a bit below what you would expect from JITB but hey, you can understand that sometimes.
What I had more trouble with was the bad service, specially in the drive thru.
I don‚Äôt know if their system is failing but I ended up screaming and repeating myself so many times before she sounded and looked upset.
I‚Äôm the one who should be more upset since the one paying for a service is myself.
These things could be easily fixed if they keep their team, and equipment up to date.
Sorry but I‚Äôm not coming back!
Jack in the Box should be ashamed.
They have a skeleton crew working at this site.
They are next to a trolley station in the middle of downtown, and it only had 4 workers.
From what I observed, it was one person taking the drive-thru orders, one at the counter, one making the food, and one other person cleaning.
This location is extremely busy, and it's unacceptable that they would have the workers like this.
JACK IN THE BOX, if you don't want to pay your crew a fair wage, and rather have a skeleton crew, then do us all a favor and just shut down your business in expensive cities.
Having a skeleton crew affects the quality of food, the working conditions for your crew, and customers.
This is meant to be fast food.
Now it's only fast made food whenever they get to your order.
In my case, my order sat at the back counter because they didn't have someone to help with the online orders.
If your customers can't rely on your "fast food" being ready in less than 25 min, just shut this site down.
The food itself was good, served hot, but unfortunately, the order was completely incorrect.
This discrepancy wasn't noticed until we were about two bites in.
It's crucial for the staff to double-check orders before handing them to customers, as receiving the wrong order can be quite frustrating.
In addition to the mix-up, the service was not up to par, and there was an unfavorable attitude from the server.
Place is sketchy.
Homeless just hang out inside the restaurant the girl behind the counter speaks very softly, I struggled to hear her.
One guy had his dog and wagon of belongings inside the store.
Breakfast sandwich was good though.
Nice little restaurant in the heart of downtown San Diego.
If you are looking for something different definitely try this place.
Indoor and outside seating.
Prompt service.
Ordered the chicken, sweet corn and basil and the apple for dessert.
Only complaint is the empanadas could have been hotter and chimichurri needs more herbs.
Absolutely delicious!!
We tried the spicy beef, chicken, lamb and caprese empanadas in our group.
Every one of them was mouthwatering good.
I‚Äôd move to San Diego just to be able to eat here all the time!
After a long day at the Baloboa Park we wandered past the San Diego High School and City college down Park Street and decided to walk towards the downtown on C Street.
We saw this beautifully painted bright yellow store front and decided to give it a shot.
From the outside walking in, the mouth-watering smell of the kitchen smells lured us in this lambently lit area.
There's a couple of see-thru display showcasing the empanadas so you can pick exactly which one you want.
The excellent options of flavors is very broad.
They offer vegetarian, beef, chicken, mushroom, lamb and more!
We tried the chicken, ratatouille veggie and beef empanadas.
They are the best empanadas I've had!
The  chimichurri sauce both spicy and regular are very delightful!
The spicy is perfect.
I recommend everyone to go here and try this out.
Absolutely great little place serving delicious meat pockets.
I've had to go here a couple times before I could try their lamb empanadas, they sold out on previous days before noon.
I would definitely recommend getting their house made chimichurri sauce to go with your pockets.
I also love how each empanada is crimped uniquely so that you can tell which one from your plate full you are eating.
This is a new favorite on my list of hot spots
I was looking for a bite to eat that was small and inexpensive since I had food at home and didn't want to overspend or overindulge.
As I perused Google Maps to find out what was in the area, I came across Empanada Kitchen and after reviewing the menu and determining they were in budget, I walked around the corner to their downtown location on C Street.
The place is hard to miss with bright yellow painting color blocked against a white wall with black lettering.
The venue is very clean and the menu is simple and easy to navigate.
This was my second time coming here and both times service was great.
(Shoutout to Chris and Dan!)
The second time around I ordered one instead of two empanadas and settled on the pollo (chicken) with the chimichurri.
I LOVE that the empanadas are baked versus fried for those that care about how their food is prepared.
It was flaky and not too crispy on the outside and then succulent on the inside.
The chimichurri is heavily seasoned (which I like) so if too many flavors simultaneously in your mouth isn't your kind of party, don't ask for it!
Will definitely make this a local go to spot.
If you like supporting local and small businesses, put your money where your mouth is!
Food is improving...the panko onion rings are absolutely perfect!!
So much crunch and flavor...well worth the $5/box.
Not happy with the new pricing on the menu...what used to be affordable is now costing close to $15/combo.
Some of the new deals are good and affordable.
First time in San Diego and first stop was Jack in the Box and it didn't disappoint.
A must go place for a good burger fix.
The service is good lots of seating and you can walk to the harbor from here.
It's super cold in here.
They have the AC on full blast.
So if you don't like the cold, probably don't sit and eat here.
They also have homeless hanging around.
Their lettuce on my chicken sandwich was mostly white.
This is how a crispy taco looks like in this horrible Jack in the Box.
I already had bad experiences but never like this one.
Eww.
To the management, having this prime location I would take a look ok how bad this food is, personally I‚Äôll never spend a penh on this restaurant.
We tried, beef tacos, shrimps, chicken, pulled pork and their signature drinks , they were all delicious and in decent size.
It was winter we did not use but there was a cute  terrace dining area.
Well decorated with ornaments and tons of live plants.
Street Parking is challenging.
it was packed on a weekday night and we parked a couple of blocks away.
But you can pay higher with private parking.
There are some parking structures around the area.
The vibe is sooo good.
We went there when it was crowded but didn‚Äôt spend too long getting seated.
They have a variety of twists on the Benedict and their drinks are also really good.
Dominique, our bartender was really good to us and made us feel accommodated even though the restaurant was at high capacity.
Will def return

-- I can sum this up in one way: when you are known to be a ‚Äúserial owner,‚Äù that means the owner could care less about the service and what‚Äôs happening at his restaurant; he just likes the cash flow.
Read the whole review at the bottom.
I talk about my brief encounter with him.
-- Michael Glinter has traveled to 68 countries and 36 states to get the flavor of some amazing foods.
His view on reviews is simple ‚Äì Taste, Presentation, and Service.
He believes telling the reader a positive and negative unbiased look at the restaurant is essential.
-- Service: Horrific.
In fact, it was so bad that I gave below 15%, which I have never done, even at the worst restaurants.
We had a reservation.
When we first walked in, there were 2 other tables with patrons.
So, one would expect it to be a pretty smooth visit.
We waited 10 minutes to be seated.
Once we got seated, we immediately ordered a hot tottie and a coffee.
It took 18 minutes to get a coffee.
Of course, when the coffee came, the outside and plate were dirty.
We placed our order and waited.
It took 47 minutes to get the Maya Breakfast and chilaquiles.
-- I always find it interesting as you are waiting to watch the dynamics in the restaurant.
Two groups of 2 came into the restaurant and waited at the hostess stand for 12 minutes just for the bartender to come by and say someone would be out shortly.
Ten minutes later, someone finally came and sat at the two tables.
The table next to us was served their breakfast, and the lady asked for a side of green sauce.
The waitress came out with the green sauce once they were done eating.
-- Food: We finally received our food, and I will give them credit; the food looked good and tasted good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth.
The food was good.
The Jerk Shrimp, which should be served hot, was like warm.
Half of the Totopos were stale.
I would have told the waitress; however, she never even asked.
I would say this: the food was curated well and was picturesque.
-- It was a Miami Latin vibe.
It had some character.
-- Now, where does the owner come in?
I was sitting in the restaurant and texted him, letting him know how bad the service was.
He called me and said, ‚ÄúWho is this, and how did you get my number?‚Äù Here is a little tip, Peter Cich: if a patron tells you they are having a bad experience, you should change your approach.
-- My recommendation would be don‚Äôt give this guy a dime.
Please stay away from Coco Maya and his other restaurants, Miss B‚Äôs Coconut Club, Park 101, Louisiana Purchase, Q and A Restaurant, and Cococaban
10 out of 10!!
I've traveled all over the world and I've had more chilaquiles and Benedicts that I could ever count...
These were some of the best!
The views are incredible, the vibe is absolutely on point, and to top it all off, the food is actually delicious!
Definitely would recommend to anyone in the area.
Came here for lunch and I fell in love with this place!
The food was great, I LOVED the chilaquiles.
It is a heaping plate with both green and red salsa!
Usually I have to struggle and pick one or the other, but not here.
You get the best of both worlds.
I also loved their coffee cocktails.
The Carajillo was especially delicious.
And as if the food wasn‚Äôt enough, the whole vibe was impecable.
The decor took me away to a Mediterranean fantasy!
I didn‚Äôt want to leave.
We have visited two times already!
The first time we ordered a combination of snowcrab and shrimp; it was soooo good!
The seasoning was spot on, the serving was great for three people and we ate to our hearts‚Äô content.
For our second visit we ordered the alligator legs and a tray of shrimp.
Just like the first time, it was great!
For these types of dishes the staff brings all the necessary tools to enjoy the food.
They (the staff) are friendly and they happily answer questions regarding their menu.
The place itself is nice, it‚Äôs open so you do not feel stuffy.
This is definitely a place we tend to frequent in the near future.
A taste of Southern Food, our first try at this restaurant.
The Etouffee was interesting (comforting and homely) like a soup with rice.
Alligator legs were deep fried and yep tasted like chicken.
The brisket sandwich (burger) was moreish but maybe could‚Äôve been served with something like a slaw perhaps.
Collared greens was also interesting and unusual for us but I liked.
Baby Back Pork ribs were divine!
Omg the food was pneumonia..
I mean it was real southern cooking at its best... a bit pricey but definitely worth it.. my number one restaurant in San Diego.
Absolutely love üòç it
Finally, found a crawfish √©touff√©e in San Diego that comes close to eating in New Orleans.
The jambalaya was delicious as well.
Collard greens needed a tad bit more vinegar but a splash of hot sauce fixes that.
Patio in front of the back of restaurant with heaters and umbrellas depending on the weather.
The back has a view of the bay.
They have some beers from a Louisiana brewery if you want an additional taste of the south.
I must admit, the pictures on the menu and the presentation of the food were on point.
That‚Äôs about where it ends.
The red beans and rice tasted like smoked sausage not andouille and there was no flavor.
The brisket sandwich will not remind you of Texas BBQ.
According to my wife, the chicken tenders were very good but I couldn‚Äôt try them because they were fried in the same grease with the shrimp‚Ä¶the view from the patio is breathtaking!
B
Staff was very helpful and friendly as we got seated right away.
Our server made some excellent suggestions for starters such as the spicy cauliflower bowl which was very flavorful with a hint of heat along with pickled raisins, pepitas, cilantro and avocados.
We completed our order with a wonderful steak frites(ribeye) and medium well done grilled sirloin burger.
This was a very wonderful experience made special by the right attention by staffers.
The atmosphere was very pleasant and welcoming.
Made for an enjoyable evening.
Good food, slow service, dim lighting.
Lovely setting for a hotel restaurant, shares the lobby but slight separation with the bar.
My partner and I had a little weekend get away and were really pleased with the Bronze Bird, we did dinner, drinks and breakfasts throughout the weekend and every single staff member we interacted with were kind and went above and beyond.
When we went for dinner it was a really busy Saturday night, special shout out to Rob who was hosting that night and noticed any possible ruffles and smoothed them over before we even had a chance to notice.
The breakfast staff the next morning were also accommodating and kind.
Really good food and yes this is a hotel restaurant.
Had the burger, but was cooked perfectly and the fries were tasty!
Beer selection is good.
Staff was fantastic and attentive.
Husband and I went for the NYE $59 a person dinner.
Our reservation was at 6pm.
We were seated and waited 20 minutes for water to come to the table.
10 minutes after our waitress (one of four different staff who served us) took our order where I ordered the lobster bisque.
I‚Äôm a HUGE bisque fan.
This bisque reeked of seafood (not normal if the seafood is fresh or not previously frozen).
It had a thin film of cooled cream on top, letting me know that the bisque was sitting at the pass for more than a few minutes before my husbands salad ( *_*) was ready.
It was not good to be honest.
Then the main courses which were also disappointing.
My husband ordered their wagyu prime roast and I the chilean sea bass.
The wagyu was a sloppy serving of two slices slathered in its our juices and sauce, not seasoned well.
The seabass was actually fine!
a tiny bit under done but totally edible and the best part, but still a solid 6/10.
The dessert was a cute ‚ÄúHappy New Year‚Äù message written in chocolate.
It was a mousse coated piece of brownie.
Totally fine.
Overall, for $135 for less than mediocre food it was disappointing.
We were thrilled to leave but bereaved that our last meal of 2023 was spent at Bronze Bird.
I attribute all of these mishaps to lack of staff, as we watched three staff members rush around the restaurant all night.
I also credit the new menu against the mainstream menu being pushed out of the kitchen.
Maybe stick to the regular menu and plan for a holiday a tad better.
would recommend to stay away.
I wanted to love this place.
I was disappointed in the tapas.
I tried the calamari and the mushroom and Brie toasts.
Both were sweet, which I didn‚Äôt expect.
I did like the panko crust on the calamari, but they were strips, which I didn‚Äôt expect.
I wish the mushroom brie toasts did t have agave syrup on them, I think it would have been better without.
The wine was pretty good though.
It was another gem we discovered yesterday after watching a play in the civic theater.
The food was delicious and our waitress Julie with the lovely french accent provided us with a remarkable service.
Fantastic food!
This place is perfect if you want great food, great atmosphere, and a place off the beaten path away from the bulk of the tourists.
The salmon was cooked to perfection and my wife loved the scallops!
Not quite Spanish style tapas but still delicious and generous portions as well.
Paella could've used more rice crispin' at the bottom.
What a nice place to grab lunch or a full dinner with drinks.
I always walk away happy I made the trip.
Everything is made from scratch and it shows.
Wine is thoughtfully selected and pairs well with the food options.
Watermelon sangria is very tasty.
Excellent allergy awareness as well.
There is a little conflict between the name (sounds Spanish), the food (French-heavy, with Spanish and American influence), and the decor (brewpub).
But this is no reason not to check this place out.
Although the downtown location is a bit more good than most, you can get a lot of the basics here, especially when you're on a short time or money budget.
Although the Mexican food menu has unique takes on classics, all the basics are there...
But no hot coffee üòì
Have visited here serval times.
The employees are the drive thru window are very rude.
This isn't an isolated incident or isolated to one employee.
The food is typical Del Taco food which we enjoy.
At this point there is another Del Taco a couple exits away that I'll probably try instead.
Food isn't bad and the people who work here are nice even though it's clearly understaffed most of the time.
Says they're open at 8am but it's very rare that they are.
I'm guessing they schedule people to start at 8 instead of being ready to go by 8.
That's about it.
Yeah there are homeless because homeless people exist no matter how inconvenient it is for non homeless people.
Go volunteer to help them if you're going to complain about it.
I bought 2 Carne asada tortas for $10.00 by using the Del App.
The area is sketchy when you're driving in the drive-thru.
The woman who served my my food wasn't the friendliest.
The tortas tasted okay.
Poor experience last Saturday, 12/9/23 evening.
Will never return.
The area is sketchy, with homeless all around.
Understanding that this isn't co trolled by the business, the employees attitude is.
Immediately when we ordered in drive thru, the man attending us was curt and rude.
It I hate my job had a personality it would be this man.
Even in how he took and returned atm not looking at me and sounding annoyed as if we made him work there, we drove away after paying not even wanting to eat food from that man or prepared by anyone there.
It seemed overall gross like his attitude.
You're welcome, we paid for the workers to have a free snack.
It was a mistake going there, but lesson learned.
This was the first place I hit when I flew into San Diego.
I had the bacon cheese burger with fries.
The service was good, the workers were very friendly and it wasn't a long time to get food.
The burger was juicy and flavorful with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions, along with mayo.
They have a selection of beer and margaritas.
It's a nice place to sit outside and water the boats on the water.
Give them a try for yourself, and as always, my 2 cents.
Stopped to grab something to eat while walking around Seaport Village.
It's in a food court type area with other eating establishments very nearby.
A burger sounded good and the prices were very reasonable.
I got a hamburger and fries.
Both were very good.
If I'm ever in the area again I'd definitely try it again
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  I recently had the pleasure of dining at this fantastic local restaurant nestled in the heart of San Diego's picturesque Seaport Village, and I must say, it was an absolutely wonderful experience for the whole family!
The first thing that struck me was the breathtaking view of the San Diego Bay.
The serene waterfront setting, combined with the gentle sea breeze, created an inviting atmosphere that made our meal even more enjoyable.
It's the perfect spot to unwind with your loved ones while savoring some delicious food.
Now, let's talk about the food because, oh my goodness, it was simply outstanding!
The Teriyaki Burger was a delightful blend of flavors, with tender and juicy meat complemented perfectly by the sweet and savory teriyaki sauce.
And the Double Bacon Cheeseburger?
It was a carnivore's dream!
The patties were cooked to perfection, and the combination of crispy bacon and gooey cheese was heavenly.
As for the sides, I couldn't get enough of their fries and sweet potato fries.
The regular fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right, while the sweet potato fries added a delightful touch of sweetness to the meal.
It's safe to say that my taste buds were in burger and fry heaven!
But what truly sets this place apart is the friendly and attentive staff.
They made us feel like part of their restaurant family, providing top-notch service that made our visit even more enjoyable.
If you're looking for a memorable dining experience with a stunning waterfront view in the heart of San Diego, this restaurant at Seaport Village is the place to be.
With mouthwatering burgers and a warm family-friendly atmosphere, you're in for a treat.
I can't recommend it enough, and I can't wait to return for another unforgettable meal by the bay!
First time here.
Ordered cheeseburger combo.
Steep price of $17.95 for walkup service.
Young boy working register doesn‚Äôt know how to multitask as the cook would ring the bell to indicate food is ready.
The boy (looks, talks like a little boy) at counter decides to waits for customers to figure out the cashless payment system, at that time,  he could‚Äôve easily turned around and get food to front counter‚Ä¶taking less than a couple of seconds.
Lazy.
Hamburger was not bad, fries extra crunchy.
Wouldn‚Äôt spend $18 again, but wasn‚Äôt bad for my needs at the time.
Not busy at all on a beautiful Wednesday evening.
Had the place to myself.
I enjoyed the burger.
I asked the order taker if she preferred the fries or the onion rings and she says why not get both.
That I did and it was a great choice.
It‚Äôs convenient and very, very close to the Civic Center.
The food is yummy.
I‚Äôve had pastas,, Panini‚Äôs, salads, soups, and desserts.
Everything is fresh and homemade.
i‚Äôve never had something I didn‚Äôt like .Nancy, the owner,  works extremely hard, and is a sweet lady.
I highly recommend dining there for a quick, yummy reasonably priced dinner.
We came here because we were hungry and thirsty.
Good food, most of the patrons were waiting, like us, for the SD Civic Center to open.
Got the spicy shrimp Cesar wrap.
They did not hold back on spice and every bite was a masterpiece.
Would have liked a little more avocado but that‚Äôs the same everywhere.
Amazing creations ladies I‚Äôll be back.
Delicious, I have been enjoying iced coffee, featured menu, pastries, and a great conversation for the past 3 years.
Highly recommended.
Nice little hidden place downtown near the Civic center.
I feel like it has a lot more to explore on the menu and the items I tried were really good.
Will be going back for sure.
Went on tours with two separate companies this week and both recommended this place saying they were ‚Äúthe best tacos in San Diego‚Äù.
I‚Äôm no taco connoisseur, but I enjoyed my food.
I got 6 tacos for $25, which was honestly twice the amount of food I should have ordered.
Of the four kinds I tried I liked the Spicy Pork and the Tripe tacos the best.
Never had tripe before, but I asked for the workers recommendation and that‚Äôs what he gave me.
It was the most tender of all the meats.
This place is an absolute delight!
There are so many great dishes here to choose from but my favorite was the vampire tacos.
This is no ordinary Taco place.
There's a seating area upstairs that looks like it came out of the 50s that just adds to the atmosphere of the place.
My experience here did not live up to the hype.
The counter service is nice, but at the end of the day my al pastor taco was light on the meat, as you can see, and swimming in filler with no pineapple, which I expect for the style.
There are much better tacos to be found in San Diego.
Honest review!
We came on a Sunday night and it was moderately busy.
The service to order was very very poor and the folks were rude to me as I ordered.
The service is absolutely lacking except for the friendly lady at the cashier who actually smiled and we appreciated that.
The tacos were authentic and unique and had decent flavor but definitely not the best.
There was a line out the door on a late Sunday night but it moved quickly.
You line up to order your tacos and then you take them to pay at the cash register after.
There is minimally bar seating and some outdoor seatings and indoor seatings upstairs.
The place looks like it used to be a diner before.
Fun to go but wouldn‚Äôt go back.
We got there pretty early for dinner, a few minutes before 5, and the line wasn‚Äôt bad.
It got busier as time passed though.
Food was excellent.
Staff were good about directing people to the appropriate line.
Tried three different food items and they were all good.
Individual tacos aren‚Äôt super big.
Horchata from the drink machine was surprisingly good.
We recently had the pleasure of dining at Darband in Little Italy, located in downtown San Diego.
The experience was nothing short of amazing.
Our server, Hussein, was outstanding - his service was both warm and professional.
The food is a highlight, offering a symphony of flavors in every bite.
The meat dishes stand out for their superb quality and taste, and the appetizers, especially the hummus, are simply delightful.
Every dish we tried was fresh, tasty, and well-prepared.
Darband is a gem that provides a memorable dining experience, leaving us completely satisfied.
Highly recommend for a taste of excellence!
Really good Persian food.
Succulent grilled lamb shank with a mountain of basmati rice for only $22 and salmon kebab for $17 make for a filling lunch in Little Italy.
Nice to have a delicious alternative to the ubiquitous Italian cuisine.
Cheers!
Exceptional service paired with delectable, perfectly cooked food.
The juicy, generously portioned dishes truly deserve a resounding five-star rating for this fantastic dining experience.
The food is delicious.. it‚Äôs so yummy.. it‚Äôs perfect more than perfect.
The restaurant is clean, beautiful, spacious and comfortable.
The guys are so friendly, they are so nice and polite.
I had the most incredible dining experience at Darband Persian restaurant in Little Italy, San Diego.
From the moment I walked in, the warm and inviting ambiance immediately put me at ease.
The restaurant's elegant decor and cozy atmosphere made it the perfect place to enjoy a delightful meal.
Now, let's talk about the food ‚Äì it was truly outstanding!
Darband offers the best Persian cuisine I've ever tasted.
Every dish was a burst of authentic flavors and impeccable seasoning, leaving me craving for more.
The kebabs were succulent and grilled to perfection, and the saffron-infused rice was a heavenly accompaniment.
The chef's dedication to using top-quality ingredients was evident in every bite, and the attention to detail in the presentation made the dishes even more enticing.
The service was impeccable, with the staff being attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal.
They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent recommendations, enhancing the overall dining experience.
Another notable aspect was the generous portions, ensuring that no one leaves the restaurant unsatisfied.
Despite the fantastic quality, the prices were reasonable, making Darband a great value for the exceptional food they offer.
If you're a fan of Persian cuisine or looking to try something new, I can't recommend Darband enough.
It's a hidden gem in Little Italy, San Diego, and a culinary journey that will leave you with a lasting impression.
I can't wait to return and indulge in more of their best-in-class dishes!"
Amazing breakfast... Well worth the wait.
This is a very good place for breakfast they have lots of seating and usually have a wait but the line moves fast.
You can use their site to add yourself to the wait list before you arrive, so that's good.
But, if the place is packed it takes a little long for your food to come out.
We had to wait a little bit for our food.
I hoped the service would have been more attentive and checked in.
We also had a kid with us and it was unusual to get a kids meal after our meal.
The place has a very nice and open atmosphere and if you are wanting to catch up on a sport while enjoying your brunch, they have plenty of TVs to do so.
The food was really good and refreshing, posting photos for some eye candy.
The host also was nice enough to give us pointers on the sounding area, this is a must visit.
Came here for breakfast.
Service was fast.
I was seated almost immediately and my server brought out a cup of coffee for me to start on right away.
This guy worked fast and monitored everyone in his area like a hawk.
I decided on the Greek style omelet with egg whites,  feta cheese, spinach and olives.
I also ordered a tall glass of fresh orange juice which he brought over immediately.
Sounds delicious, I thought.
While waiting for my omelet, my server came over to refill my coffee at least 3 times - one time he filled it after I had only taken 2 sips of coffee lol.
Wow, I love this guy!
Every restaurant server in America needs to learn from him.
I don't think the wait for my meal took more than about 6 minutes.
He brought out a beautiful piping hot dish with a bowl of fruit in the middle that looked delicious.
I dug in as I was pretty hungry.
It was good with a real strong Mediterranean flavor.
The only issue I had with the omelet was there were just too many olives stuffed inside which overpowered the rest of the ingredients.
I pulled out at least 10 olives and now the meal tasted much better.
The meal was a little pricey at $28 but the food was good quality.
The fruit was fresh, the coffee hot and satisfying and orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.
Last year, during the Padre's season, we met up with friends from Orange County before a game and wanted to grab some brekky beforehand.
It was last minute, and surprisingly, the wait was only about 6 minutes, and we got our food right away.
The food was excellent, consistent with the Pacific Beach and Mission Valley locations that we both frequent, and we were delighted with our meals.
The food was excellent, drinks were good, and all of the staff here were great.
We appreciated the excellent service and great food, and I love that I can find vegan "eggs" and vegan "meat" options!
Everything was good with our visit to Broken Yolk including the service and atmosphere.
I wasn't blown away by the food, but it was good overall.
Definitely a good place for breakfast.
Really loved the simple and comforting egg noodle soup with pork and wontons.
The fried wontons were super flavorful.
The egg noodles were also perfectly firm and chewy.
Banh Bot Chien Trung is my favorite here.
The place stays the same for years.
Shrimp wonton soup is ok, a bit salty to me.
Fried shrimp wonton is good too.
UPDATE: Still delicious and our go-to at least once a week.
Cannot LOVE this place enough.
Small, quaint, family-run little hole in the wall.
An absolute hidden gem.
Had the shrimp wonton noodle soup and it was exactly what I needed on this rainy day.
Parking available on the street.
Looking forward trying other items on their menu.
The noodle has a very strong alkaline taste.
When I came about 2 years ago, it does not have it.
Now, especially if I order the big bowl, it has a very strong alkaline taste.
Also, it closes very early.
When I want to go, I need to rush just to make it in time before last order.
Looking for fresh fresh Vietnamese egg noodles called Mi?
This is the spot!!
This was so good I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it!
Got 2 bowls of mi, one with broth on the side and one with shrimp wontons, an order of shrimp wontons which were the best I‚Äôve ever had-fried to perfection & stuffed w tons of shrimp!
Also got the half fried chicken which was beyond crispy and juicy!!
The flour rice pancake was delicious as well.
Overall, such a great place, we will be back!
I recently celebrated my wife's birthday at this fantastic restaurant.
The fried tofu was perfectly crispy, the Thai-style noodles were flavorful, and the miso ginger salmon was a delightful surprise.
Food came pretty quick and the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming.
The manager went above and beyond, treating us to a complimentary and delicious ice cream.
Five stars for the incredible food and exceptional service!
Title: Disappointing Service and Subpar Food at [Restaurant Name]  Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1 out of 5 stars)  I recently had an unfortunate experience at Mosiac that left me extremely disappointed and frustrated.
After a long flight, I decided to order takeout from the restaurant downstairs.
However, my entire experience, from the food to the service, was far below my expectations.
While picking up the food, that person was nice.
Let me start with the hot wings.
I have never tasted anything as salty as these wings.
It was as if they had emptied an entire container of Morton's salt onto them.
I called the restaurant to express my dissatisfaction, only to be met with rudeness from the person who answered the phone.
He claimed that's how they make the wings and refused to acknowledge the excessive saltiness.
I requested to speak with someone else, hoping for a more reasonable response.
Unfortunately, the second person I spoke to was even ruder.
They dismissed my complaint and refused to consider changing the recipe or providing a refund.
Their lack of professionalism and unwillingness to address my concerns left me appalled.
Moving on to the crab fried rice with added shrimp, which cost me $12.
To my dismay, the shrimp they added was a single large shrimp sliced into small pieces.
As for the crab, despite the additional charge, I couldn't find a single piece of it in the dish.
The overall quality of the fried rice was subpar, lacking flavor and depth.
It felt like a complete rip-off considering the price I paid.
Even the fried chicken wing was disappointing.
It tasted old and lacked any seasoning or salt.
The absence of flavor made it unappetizing and unenjoyable to eat.
As a business owner myself, I understand the challenges of finding good workers and providing excellent service.
However, the service I received at Mosiac was shockingly unprofessional.
I usually refrain from writing negative reviews, but the way I was treated compelled me to share my experience.
I remained polite and reasonable throughout my interactions until the very end, when I couldn't tolerate their rudeness any longer.
I expressed my disappointment and informed them that I would be disputing the charge on my Amex.
It is unacceptable for anyone to speak to customers in such a disrespectful manner.
In conclusion, my visit to MOSIACS was an extremely disappointing one.
The excessively salty hot wings, lackluster crab fried rice, and old-tasting fried chicken, combined with the rude and unhelpful service, have left a lasting negative impression.
I hope that the management of MOSIACS takes this feedback seriously and makes the necessary improvements to provide better experiences for their customers in the future.
Lovely restaurant.
I made a reservation on OpenTable, and was lead to my seat with a little "reserved" sign as soon as I arrived.
Staff was attentive but not overbearing, checking on how things were several times throughout the meal, and very nice and friendly.
Food was outstanding.
I had the roasted lamb chop appetizer, juicy and flavorful, the miso ginger salmon entree, which had this incredible smoky flavor, and finished it off with the chocolate molten cake, rich and dark and not too sweet, so perfect for me.
All in all a wonderful visit.
We were there on 2/28 in the evening.
Service was slow, and the food was slow and/or unavailable.
We were told 1/2 hour AFTER we ordered that our menu item was not available.
The 2nd choice took another 1/2 hour.
We were the ONLY customers there.
The waiter kept saying he had no control over the kitchen.
He sent the GM out to give us a bottle of wine to take home.
We would have preferred an explanation for the poor service or a meal comp.
We had not been here for a while, and it seems things have changed.
There used to be great service and fun wait staff.
We went there for Valentines day .
friendly staff.
food was good .
they also gifted us a nice bottle of wine.
Had a late lunch here on a  Wednesday afternoon.
The service was good from.both the cashier and the chef.
We ordered the Mahi Mahi Sliders and some Fish & Chips.
The sliders were tasty but in my opinion the fish and chips was superior.
The portion size was quite generous, the fish tasted fresh and was fried to perfection.
Another thing I appreciated is the very ingenious design on the bar itself.
It has various sea creatures in what looks like a beach made of resin, really cute ü•∞
Decent place with amp choices of seafood items.
Was not happy about the ~4% service fee for takeout, seriously?!
You get 1 star docked automatically.
I got the teriyaki salmon bowl.
A little stingy on the rice given the price.
Salmon was good and tender.
Atmospheric can be a little loud and not as spacious, but that San Pedro.
Might be worth coming again if feeling the itch.
Heard from others that the lobster roll isn‚Äôt good and to stick with Old Port.
Amazing cioppino.
Filled with seafood.
Only improvement is a real soup spoon instead of the dinky plastic one provided.
Had the fish and chips and a cup of clam chowder.
Fish & chips were good and the portion was good, look at the photo!
Fish was proper Cod ftw!
Good job Anchor.
Fries (few places serve "chips") were crispy and tender.
Clam chowder was surprisingly good.
I tend to not have high expectations for clam chowder since many places just don't do it justice.
This was definitely way better than the overhyped Sam's Chowder house, which we've written off.
My daughter tipped the cup back to get every drop.
The Halibut Fish Chips was excellent.
The fish was great, and the fries were good.
Great atmosphere in this San Pedro Square.
Delicious food.
Plenty of options.
Clean spot.
Few chairs to sit up at the bar.
Close bathroom...
Tidy little place serving delicious food.
We had a sampler appetizer platter.
All will well prepared and delicious.
The garlic sauce is the bomb.
The shrimp in garlic was generous portion.
The tostones were perfectly caramelized not burnt.
Thoroughly enjoyed a delicious meal.
It's a food court area so different tastes can be explored.
And there's a bar a few steps away should you wish for a beer with your meal.
Good enough to go back and explore more.
Fidel would be rolling in his grave at this abomination of a Cuban sandwich.
Ordered delivery at a nearby hotel; the food was bland uninspiring and the meat just tasted off like it wasn't fresh.
The only edible thing in the delivery was the black beans... yay.
The flan was clear & gelatinous like someone dissolved colored water in pectin and let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours.
I never expected Cuban food like Versailles Restaurant in Miami but this was very disappointing.
Was in the area for the CDA convention and this location has many small restaurants and woww this sandwich was very good never had one like this before
Huge portions, even small plates (or appetizers) are too big to be consumed in one sitting.
Really delicious though!
Delicious!!!
Great portions!!!
Escovitch red snapper (skankin‚Äô sweet) and the brown stewed red snapper (one love) were amazing.
I forgot to grab my festival but I could not even eat half of the food.
The restaurant was very clean and welcoming.
Island Taste is a hidden gem in the Bay Area, offering a truly authentic Caribbean dining experience.
The Jerk Chicken is a standout dish, bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked every time.
What sets this place apart is its rare offering of both Jamaican and Haitian cuisine, making it a go-to spot for anyone craving a taste of the islands.
The vibrant atmosphere adds to the experience, with reggae tunes and colorful decor transporting you straight to paradise.
The staff are friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall warmth of the place.
If you're in the mood for delicious Caribbean fare served with a side of island vibes, Island Taste is the place to be.
We stopped by on our day trip to San Jose from Monterey.
Thank you to the owner who was quite courteous to us and made the experience more than we could‚Äôve asked.
Great conversation.
Very welcoming.
The food was delicious!
Very tender and flavorful meats.
I love curry goat so I had to try it first!
My brother got the brown stewed chicken.
Everything was on point.
The beef patties were also scrumptious.
We got multiple flavors and I froze the leftover patties so I can enjoy them later.
Thank you Island taste for serving us good eats!
We will be visiting again.
I just had my first taste of Jamaican food here today.
It was amazing!
The beef patty was super flavorful and so were the wings.
The Jerk Chicken Plate took it all to the next level.
It was smokier than the wings and made a huge difference.
The sides were also delicious, especially the rice and the cabbage stuff.
Lamar and Alex (I hope I heard your names correctly) were super friendly and welcoming.
The Food came out very quickly too.
Can't go wrong here as far as I know.
Will be coming back.
I tried oxtail with rice/peas, cabbage, and beed patty.
All where good.
Restaurant is decorated nicely and very clean.
Service is quick.
Good selection of Caribbean soft drinks and beers.
I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich which was really good.
The fries were good too.
The music playing inside the restaurant was kinda loud and not the kind of music I'd like to listen to while I eat, but aside from that it's a nice place.
Expensive , slow and mediocre food at best.
No inspiration with low level of care.
I was surprised that an egg and cheese sandwich was $13.
Expected something more inspiring than what arrived.
Under new management.
Delicious food.
They have everything they had before but 10 times better.
They have added the most amazing Mexican dishes!
Have some fresh orange juice.
Love this place.
Check out my breakfast with fried banana.
Yum
Consistently great food & a wide variety of it.
The main server is always super welcoming as well.
Formerly creasian this spot is now a great sandwich spot.
The milkshakes seem to be very popular.
Solid happy hour and a few TVs to watch sports.
Very local fish and chips spot near the light rail station and the convention center.
Amazing customer service!!
He was nice enough to refill my water bottle when we ate there.
The fish was good but just a tad greasy.
If it was slightly less greasy it would be perfect!
I loved the tartar sauce it came with.
Great sea food.
Great service.
Awesome selection of craft beers.
Also great value fish and chips.
I decided to splurge on lobster roll and it did not disappoint.
A must go.
Dear lord!!!
I'll fly from Toronto again just to come here!
The food is amazing.
The turn around for the order was insanely quick!!!
Ordered Oysters omg...too good, The Scallops and shrimp with amazing and not too mention the crab cakes... Could not help but to order another dozen of Oysters!!
If you want quality then this is the place!!
!
Food was good service was good and the restaurant was very clean, portions were on point.
Would definitely go back.
We hade the sea bass and the salmon.
Service was the best you could ever hope for, Doug was just outstanding.
All of the food was amazing and very good prices.
Definitely recommend to anyone.
This location is not too bad.
I live around the corner and appreciate the late night hours and 2 tacos for .99 if ordering through the app.
The people working handle the crowd and get you what you ask for.
They work to get people in and out.
It‚Äôs usually pretty clean and I don‚Äôt know if the bathrooms are open.
Probably good not to open, downtown can be dirty.
Best Jack in the Box I've been to in a while!
The cashier was really friendly and even gave the 3 of us our orders in our own bags without asking even though it was one check.
Burgers were tasty with just the right amount of sauce.
Definitely fulfilled that 1am craving!
Very tasty and inexpensive.
Wonderful service.
I flew in from Australia and arrived in San Jose at 11pm after 24 hours of travel.
I was hungry and this was the only place open and was actually a surprisingly pleasant experience.
NO PARKING.
NO DRIVE THRU.
NO 24 HRS SERVICE.
Parking is for friends and employees only.
That's what I Saw.
I was a regular there.
Not anymore.This happened on Feb 3, 2024 about 6.
30 pm I was a regular client.
Till today.
The employee won't let me use the restroom.
Why employees think that customers are stupid!!?
This employee let 3 females customers at same to use the restroom.
Then another female she didn't even bought anything.
Then he let a guy to use the restroom.
But when I asked him if I can use the restroom.
His reply was WE DON'T HAVE ONE!!
I told him.
I just spent money here.
He replied.
Yeah but it's leaking.
So he let 5 people in the restroom.
But when I asked him to let me use the restroom.
He tells me we don't have one!!?
When I was sitting steps from the restroom.
Even though he knows I just spent $14.
I wonder what was his problem.
But for sure I will spend my money next door restaurant.
Don't waste your time waiting at the Drive thru from 3:30 to 4:00 am They don't serve you.
I was seating there for like a30 plus minutes waiting and when I'm make it to The order what they tell me...
Sorry we closed üîí for the next 30 Minutes come back after 4:00am
Great food!!!
Very authentic and clean on my pallet...
Salad was nice also!!!
Gyro plate for the win!!
!
So I ordered 2 gyro bowls and I told the girl I wanted extra rice on both bowls then I get home and I open it up and I put my fork in to take a bite the fork literally hit the bottom so I took a bite then I see that there‚Äôs barley any rice witch is crazy then I call and the same girl who took my order awnsered  and I told her what happened then she said normally it‚Äôs one scoop of rice for a regular gryo bowl and 2 scoops of rice for the gyro bowls with extra rice and I told her there‚Äôs no way that it had 2 scoops of rice because I worked there for a whole year I know how the bowls are supposed to look like but it‚Äôs a shame she didn‚Äôt offer to make things good with me as a customer because when I was working there the manager told me if anything happened with a customers me as a cashier I‚Äôm supposed to make things right and refund them and fix there order I wasn‚Äôt looking for a refund but I wanted what I paid for I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs under different management now but still that‚Äôs wrong I just hope the owner sees this I can forsure do a better job than her for a fact but other than that the food is good I love there food
Had a gyro wrap, Greek Salad, hummus and pita, and froyo for desert.
Everything was delicious and I ate it all.
I will definitely be coming back.
This Greek food place has been a Go-to favorite.
The gyro plate/ bowls fresh and served at really good portion.
Their specialty Frozen yogurt dessert with honey and baklava is my favorite.
Also, their Greek fries is good too.
Good Greek food in and around San Jose downtown.
We paid $23 for this.
Young guys working here and have no idea on how to serve good fresh food.
Amy was super awesome when asked what are some of the most ordered items.
I eventually went with the Super Beef Burrito and IT WAS AMAZING holy cow not an inch of the thing was dry and every bite was as flavourful as the first.
Don't even get me started about the famous orange sauce, that thing was to die for.
All in all if you are in the area you MUST grab something here!
I haven't been to this location in years (~10), so I was pleased to see the interior had been professionally painted and the seating area reconfigured.
It was quite clean, considering it's a campus location.
The food is the same, which is reassuring.
I had a Breakfast Burrito with bacon and potatoes.
Hubs had a Carne Asada plate that was plentiful.
He couldn't eat it all, which is unusual for him.
The leftover meat made a great omelet the next day.
And then, there's the Orange Sauce, uniquely La Victoria and delicious.
Clearly, they survived the pandemic and didn't seem to have lost their edge.
The food was just as I fondly remembered it.
We lucked up with street parking, as it was a holiday.
But can anyone tell me what this is?
San Jose's staple late night Taco stop!
I got the super burrito made it wet with both red and green sauce (she said it was extra charge I told her it was worth every penny)  I also got SUPER nacho fries for the table.
I always get a large horchata.
Dirty.
Oily.
Bigger than you expect.
1500 calories and a good time for you and your friends.
Open late.
Probably backed up on door dash orders.
Be kind.
Tip well.
Eat well.
Been comin here for decades‚Ä¶this morning we ordered breakfast burritos, and some fresh juice.
They were also very nice to make me some fresh hot coffee.
La Victoria Taqueria is an absolute gem in the heart of San Jose, and its long-standing reputation is well-deserved.
The flavors and authenticity of their Mexican cuisine have won the hearts and taste buds of locals and visitors alike.
The tacos, burritos, and other Mexican delights are still delicious, with vibrant and well-balanced flavors that keep you coming back for more.
The friendly staff and lively atmosphere add to the overall experience, creating a vibrant and inviting space to enjoy your meal.
However, it's worth mentioning that in recent years, some patrons have noticed a slight decline in the overall quality.
While still tasty, some feel that the ingredients and flavors don't quite reach the same heights as they once did.
Nonetheless, La Victoria Taqueria remains a must-visit spot for Mexican food enthusiasts, offering a slice of culinary tradition and a memorable dining experience.
I was craving the classic Pho soup while traveling in the area and that place was perfect.
A genuine Vietnamese mom and pop shop with huge portions and very chill no frills vibe.
The soup was godly.
Maybe the fact that I was hungry helped too.
Not the place for fine dining and fancy food though.
This place dates back to the late 70s when Dionne Warwick was singing about   San Jose.
Da Lat itself is a large city in the central region of  Vietnam  Food is solid, decor not so much.
Prices are about 15 to 20 percent lower than most other places, especially the newer trendier places.
This is your grandparents' Vietnamese restaurant and the clientele is there to match.
There is a little bit of everything here but is seems Da Lat is better at rice rishes and cold noodle bowls.
Pho is a southern Vietnamese specialty and may not be what Da Lat specializes in.
I could be wrong.
The egg rolls and spring rolls were hefty and good.
I had the grilled pork chop rice plate.
The portions are easily enough for 2 people.
Ask for a fried egg on top.
A mix of locals, students and even cops eat here.
Some people park on the sidewalk, but most park on the street.
Don't go to Da Lat for the atmosphere but do go there for the food.
Other people have for over 40 years.
I‚Äôve been coming to Dat Lat since I was a kid, we are loyal customer who always recommend and bring friends and family members to eat here.
I am so disappointed at what has recently happened when my family visited.
The guy at the front taking payment wouldn‚Äôt accept a bill my dad was trying to pay with because it was ‚Äútoo old‚Äù.
He had just got the bill from the bank and showed him it was real.
The man declined and wouldn‚Äôt accept.
My parents were disappointed but went back again because we enjoy the food.
Huge mistake.
They came an hour till closing and the same man rushed them and asked them to pay already and if they were almost done.
Why welcome customers in and serve if you‚Äôre gonna rush?
Integrity and service has gone out the window at this place.
It is also filthy and floors and walls look disgusting.
You all are better off giving business to people who still care for their customers.
Best Banh Xeo I‚Äôve ever had!
They were ginormous and filled with plenty of pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts.
Comes with plenty of fresh vegetables on the side.
Highly recommend!
Had order the pho tai.
It was not great at all.
Will never ever order pho from this restaurant ever again.
The rare steak was already cooked when I got it.
The broth is too sweet.
There is definitely msg in the food as I was having to drink water with my food constantly.
Went back and had tacos today.
Made a mental note to come here more often, it's a great little spot.
Tacos: Asada, Al Pastor & Cueritos (my new favorite)  ******************************* I've been wanting to check this place out and my daughter reminded me today, so we checked it out.
She chose the shrimp cocktail and I chose the Campechana which is a shrimp cocktail plus octopus.
The portions were ridiculously large and very much worth the $18 and $19 bucks.
Service was fast, friendly and welcoming.
The decor was an absolute vibe, I want to come back here for after work drinks one of these days, those micheladas looked pretty enticing.
I popped in late one Saturday night and they hooked me up with the fattest al pastor super burrito.
Hunger be gone!
It proclaimed as it filled me to the brim.
Pretty solid menu with lots of options.
Their salsa verde is crazy delicious with a nice kick.
They always send me away with some chips, sliced cucumber, radish and lime wedges as well, so you get all the accoutrements.
Will return soon!
So tasty food i personally give all my stars for carlos me and my family received an excellent service from him and he prepared the best drinks my favorite is the mojito
Came for a lunch meeting and was greeted by amicable staff.
Plenty of items to choose from the menu and glad to see a dedicated torta menu as this is my jam.
Ordered the Torta Oaxace√±a - full of meat and cheese, on a big slice of bread.
Very filling.
Good ambiance, tv and laser lights.
Music a little loud but for the small space it is reasonable.
Fairly priced for the food downtown.
Parking available in the plaza behind.
Al fresco dining in the back.
Great business owner under fairly new ownership.
Big menu, but seem to specialize in the tortas so that's what I got.
It was delicious and huge.
Service was great at the start but then hard to find people at the end.
I was there at lunch on a Monday and it was pretty empty.
Think they were doing inventory or getting a shipment at the time.
I'd consider coming again.
Food was good and came out quickly.
In A Nutshell:  -It's funny to write this review about Urban Momo b/c I lived in SJ for years and this was the 2nd restaurant to open up in this same stall, but I never got around to trying it until a recent visit back home.
-I kick myself in the arse now b/c damn their food is really good.
-There are only 3 restaurants left (Phonemenal, Market Beer Company and Pizza Bocca Lupo) when San Pedro Market originally opened up back in 2010, but Urban Momo should be added to that group since they are the 2nd longest lasting restaurant there.
-I ordered a bunch of things such as their Simosas, Naan & Spicy Tandori Chicken.
-Everything was so mouth-watering good, especially the Tandori Spicy Chicken.
-For around $20 something bucks you can get a very large portion of delicious finger licking chicken.
-It's a great deal, very healthy too.
Overall, if you are in the mood for Nepalese/Indian food, this is the place to get some!
Delicious food & a local San Jose favorite!
Tried the chicken curry, aloo gobi, & fried rice with naan - would highly recommend all these dishes.
This comes with a big thanks from our NYU student film cast & crew!
Definitely a spot worth checking out.
I ordered chicken biryani, veg noodles and garlic noodles.
And none of the dishes were worth eating!
Found it pretty tasteless!
Do not recommend this restaurant.
I had chiken biryani,  I liked the taste.
The rice was spicy and flavorful and the chicken was well marinated and soft.
On another visit I tried their mixed Shezwan fried rice, the fried rice was good but they one small container of the Shezwan sauce which is not sufficient for the full dish.
The fried rice had a good combination of veggies,  eggs and chicken.
This place is located inside San Pedro square market.
Lovely atmosphere.
We ordered Paneer momos, Veg chowmein, some fries and Manchurian.
Fries were super crispy and delicious.
Veg chowmein was okay.
Manchurian was my favorite.
We went pretty early there and still it took more than half an hour.
Great location, reasonable prices, solid food.
I like the dips, the warm pita is delicious, we had a salad and the meatballs.
Also, their cocktails are absolutely delicious!
I also really like that they are an open table and you can make a reservation, that is not as common as it should be for this geographic area.
Truly great food, a tad on the spendy side but not overly.
My date and I were both surprised with the lack of people for Friday night, I made reservations but clearly didn't need to.
The food was really good, the bread pudding was exceptional but I think what would take it over the top would be some sort of sauce.
Opa!
has a great downtown location that isn't busy and has a great atmosphere for a nice dinner.
Made a reservation for 7-8 people a few days prior and it was a seamless process.
When we arrived on a Saturday evening, it wasn't packed at all so it made the perfect spot for our dinner gathering.
Our table started off with a few items including their dolmas, falafels, and zucchini chips.
Their falafels were great and definitely a firmer texture than what I am used to, but it was seasoned well and a great starter.
The chips were also a tasty treat while we enjoyed some drinks too.
I ended up ordering one of their Greek Salads (minus the cheese) and topped with some more falafels for protein.
The greens were fresh and quite filling despite originally thinking it wasn't going to be enough food.
Overall, a good spot and I'd consider coming back again.
$60 for one drink, chicken entree, and flaming cheese with pita bread.
Price isn‚Äôt everything but poor service makes you rethink going there again.
Food was good.
I‚Äôd return here for a date but not casual dining.
Service was fast.
But there was only one person working front of the house.
She was the host, bartender and server.
This is unacceptable for many reasons.
I like the ambience , TVs on the wall and seating.
Parking is abysmal.
Parking garages are insanely priced.
Street parking is sometimes available.
Plan ahead or Uber there.
Value for money 1/5 Quality of food 3/5 Speed of service 4/5 Quality of service 1/5 Return value 1/5
Came here to celebrate my friends birthday for lunch.
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was good, not too loud so we could all catch up.
Definitely recommend.
Service was very fast, this place is a must to try for the ones who love burritos and even for those who don't, this people really know how to satisfy the palate and stomach of other people who want to eat well and in abundance.
Seen in a Man-vs-food episode, my expectations was very high and not only they really didn't disappointed me, but match my dreams to eat the American way: plentiful and tasty.
Not made on purpose, but I preferred the burrito to taco Tuesday on that very day.
Taken a super burrito, I've choosen "Al pastor".
Highly recommended.
I wish I had taken pictures of the food, but I was too famished to remember.
I ended up getting it to go anyway.
The place was spotless, and I actually loved the entrance.
It felt like I was entering a roller coaster line queue ‚Äì pretty cool, right?
I ordered a chicken burrito and a steak burrito.
They were quite tasty.
But let me highly recommend the horchata; it's so good that I wish I could have it every day.
The steak nachos were alright, with generous toppings, crunchy, authentic tortilla chips that reminded me of the ones I enjoy at Superior ‚Äì similar taste and crunch.
The fries were excellent, crispy and not overly potatoey.
The service here was outstanding.
The guy at the register was friendly, explained everything well, and had a pleasant speaking voice.
He managed to be laid-back and professional at the same time.
Apologies for not leaving a tip; I think I got overwhelmed and didn't see the tip option.
I usually always tip small businesses.
I'll make sure to do that next time!
Now, let's talk about the orange sauce ‚Äì it was spicy for me but incredibly tasty!
There's ample seating both inside and outside.
I typically expect stuffy and humid environments in places like this, but it felt clean and had fresh air.
The tables were well-kept.
One thing to note is that they don't give you an order number, so make sure you keep an eye on your order.
We certainly didn't hear any numbers being called, so a kind customer in the other dining area kept repeating the number to us.
I'll definitely return here.
The only downside for me is the color scheme inside.
I understand it's iguana-themed, but to me, it felt a bit tacky, like a childhood room decorated with a Minecraft theme.
I think a cooler, more modern urban iguana theme would be great.
The outside looks cool and hip, but once you're inside, it feels a bit underwhelming.
Also, note that the restroom door is locked.
Great food!
Was a little disappointed that they didn't get Spotify premium though -- really brings the vibe down when some ads come on through the music.
C'mon, it's barely $15 a month!
The restaurant exterior is flashy and impressive, especially at night.
Best street tacos asada in the Bay Area, no joke ü§üüëçü´∂I never tried anything else because I don‚Äôt think anything would top tacos asada ü§§üòπbut I‚Äôm sure the rest is as delicious
First time eating at the restaurant was super hyped to try it out every disappointed Order nacho fires no meat to be seen and no fork to eat with had use a spoon what the lady said , if I knew that in being would have not ordered it.
The tacos were ok but not worth the money tbh every sad about this spot
We ordered veggie wet burrito and Magic veggie nachos.
It's our favorites and it never disappoints us.
It was really good.
The food was amazing and I really enjoyed the ambiance while I waited for my order.
The lady that took my order was very sweet with a great attitude.
The only reason for my 4 stars that I would have gave them 5, except I ordered no beans with my salad and when I got home, guess what I had with my salad?
That‚Äôs right, beans lol.
And I wasn‚Äôt about to drive all the way back.
Luckily they were black beans and so I picked them out üòä
Tucked away in the neighborhood.
The quesadillas are well made.
Crispy outside and filled with meat & cheese .
They have an outdoor covered patio.
They built it around an old pepper tree.
We were looking for an authentic, hole in the wall, great food experience and voila!
Wet Burrito was the answer.
Knocked one star off for atmosphere because when the temperature rose we started to sweat out on their patio due to minimal air movement.
Would eat here again, though, and highly recommend to others wanting to try something off the beaten path!
Everything about this place screams California Burrito in a way that makes sense if you are familiar with the area.
The bad news is, if you're a local, you also know how steep competition is in the "best" burrito category.
I spent this week trying to add two more ranked entries on to my burrito list.
Both happen to take an alternative route to attacking my favorite entry in this category, Iguana's Best Burrito.
Up until now, most of my reviews for this category have featured a burrito with custom sauce that is supposed to differentiate themselves among the crowd.
That's kind of become a staple of the "California" burrito in these parts.
California Wet Burrito is different, it aims for the California flavors using ingredients rather than sauces.
The availability of refried beans and shredded chicken are a dead giveaway that a burrito order here is more tradition (as much as Mexican food invented in America can be) than at some of the other places around town.
You get a choice of red or green salsa, but it's clearly not meant to be a competitor to something like La Vic's orange sauce.
In the end, I simply ended up using Valentino's at the house.
With that said, it was that kind of experience, unexceptional.
It wasn't a bad burrito by any means, it just could have been any nameless burrito around here.
If restaurants are going to make burritos in a more "traditional" style, that bar is going to be really high around here, and this experience just wasn't good enough to crack the top ten.
Great experience üî•üî•  Best place with very affordable prices to have some Thai food in San Jose downtown Tried their yellow curry red curry with chicken so tasty Their pad Thai noodles is good  Thai famous Ground Chicken over rice with  fried egg is signature dish best taste one need to try excellent dish I personally liked  People should encourage them üëçüëç
Authentic Thai, and a long line at the counter to get lunch.
I had the 2 dish combo, huge mound of rice and 2 entree's - garlic chicken & pineapple curry w chicken.
Both were good, both were spicy.
There's also made to order, seems like the line was longer for that.
(Pad Thai to go?)
Very clean.
Came for lunch and was greeted by amicable staff.
The pleasant taste of the chicken curry was very palatable and was had a balanced flavor.
Paid Street parking nearby and in front.
Quick service and clean establishment.
An unpretentious place, clean, bright, airy, with a simple and complete menu and friendly staff.
The food is just right (taste, smell, color, temperature) and you will receive good portions and very affordable prices.
Oh!
and you can see the people in the kitchen doing everything from scratch.
Bonus point: THE FRESH CANE SUGAR JUICE, you have to try it!
(also you see when they are doing it for you).
Definitely give this place a try when you want to have a comfortable meal full of Thai flavor.
Tastewise it‚Äôs good but nothing to write home about.
Their prices after their last raise is too high, and they also give you a very low quality plastic fork (which starts bending since the food is hot) - not very healthy.
Hence the two stars
In the heart of downtown San Jose by San Jose State University and the city of San Jose mayor's office is this Vietnamese pho (soup) restaurant.
Traditional noodles soups as we'll as plate dishes.
I had the combination noodle beef soup.
Very tasty like I remember with chicken egg rolls.
Unassuming place and location, but good food.
A favorite restaurant for many Hispanic customers.
On a late Sunday afternoon, we are the only Asian customers out of 10 families present.
For the combination you get 2 shrimps, 2 beef balls,  chicken , pork, and your choice of noodles in a bowl of very flavorful soup, all for about $12.
Employees are not rude, typical of Asian restaurants , just like in Asia.
Never pressured to give tips.
Good, healthy, and affordable food.
üëç
Excellent value for money.
My combination won ton noodles came with 5 won tons, 2 prawns and various other pieces of meat.
It also has authentic pork fat crackling.
Shallots and coriander added to the flavour.
It definitely fits the budget conscious.
A small pot of tea was under $1.
This is a large spacious place which at an estimate can seat about 100 people.
No frills place and no frills service.
It is open from 8 am which makes it an ideal first stop for the tourist.
This spot has been here forever it seems and the food quality always stays the same (for me, at least!).
I love their fried rice, combo rice stick soup, and crispy fried noodles.
I always received good customer service there!
I was there with my friend.
We ordered a noodle for each of us, and I found a hair in my noodle‚Ä¶.ü§ÆI called the waiter to return it but he gave me a new one(there was something like hair as shown in the picture) we also asked for water but the waiter didn‚Äôt serve it to us.
Tastewise, not recommended.
Environment was so-so.
Will never go back there.
Perfect lunch stop on our way to Monterey Bay!
My partner recommended the place and said it was great years ago and it is still great to this day!
The pho was super tasty and the broth was very rich.
The Vietnamese coffee kept me awake all day.
The lemonade never arrived but they were super friendly and nice and took it off the bill.
I‚Äôll stop here again if we are driving past San Jose.
Omg now I want pho now.
I really enjoyed their stir fry sitting on top of crispy noodles.
The flavor was hearty and lightly salted.
The vegetables taste better than the meat.
The noodles never got too soggy either.
Outdoor paint by the wall looks great  and modern that's  why we decided to try it when we walked by.
However inside  was  outdated, looks like street style shack back in vietnam.
Pricing is OK,  bowl comes in 2 sizes small& large.
We decided to order  # 1 brisket with add on  beef balls  for both bowls.
My partner got complete order  however mine was missing    beef ball , i told the  male server  then a lady came in by our table and decided to scoop out my bowl with her spoon  searching for the "beef ball" that wasn't  there.
I was disgusted and lost my appetite  .
Find it very appropriate  to just scoop out someone else's  food esp paying customers.
Nothing special on the pho was quite basic.
The only place in the world that knows how to cook the authentic North Vietnamese Pho.
And yes, I've been everywhere.
A couple other dishes are special too, the crispy Pho Ap Chao and the banana brule (the caramelized banana burned in rum).
It‚Äôs a shame.
I really wanted to like this place, but the pho was just not good.
Very shallow broth, missing all the characteristic pho spices like anise.
Not much more depth than salt water.
The menu selection was limited compared to almost any pho place you‚Äôll find; they didn‚Äôt even have tendon.
Prices were as expected for this part of town.
Totally loved the place.
Went there on a Sunday outing.
The location, the decor and the each element adds to the vibe of the place and is definitely a nest for hangouts, as the name suggests.
On that same note, I‚Äôd say the food was pretty basic.
Did not feel like restaurant food at all.
But the beauty of the place helped us enjoy the food.
I would recommend the place for good hangout place but not for the food.
Wow, the bahn mi flight was DELICIOUS  Chill relaxing joint with tasty food.
It can take a lil bit of time for the items to come out of the kitchen when it's busy.
Still lovely
Really mediocre food, flavor was okay.
The fries had no salt.
And the dry rubs both tasted the same.
Also .60¬¢ for sauces that are half full is not a vibe.
Definitely ask for more than one sauce cup they are small as well.
We had a great experience here.
Pork Sandwich was really good.
Tasty.
New flavor for me.
Good size for two if you ask chicken wings and share.
The wings were amazing.
The place has good ambiance.
Pet friendly.
They have seating inside and out side.
Good beer and the service was really good.
Food was decent enough, the ramen bulgogi was alright, but it was pretty clear that the noodles in it were not very high quality.
The meat was adequate, and the egg was fine.
I ate on a separate check with a friend whose order was not called, and picked up by another name.
We didn't notice the issue until going up to the register.
Staff was polite and offered us a refund or a remake.
The other short-falling was the cool breeze coming in through the open front door... And the stuttery Spotify music on the speaker.
In total, a quick bite to eat that should've taken maybe 40 min max ended up being more than an hour.
The food was great and service was excellent!
Rod was super attentive and took such amazing care of us.
The total came to $340 after tip and taxes, but we felt like it was worth it for the atmosphere, food quality, and service.
We got one appetizer, two entrees, a lobster tail add-on, a side dish, cheesecake, diet coke, and one cocktail.
In town for a little getaway and chose this place based on reviews.
One of the best experiences and most delicious steak we have ever had.
Our waiter Andy was phenomenal and really made our night extra special.
Will definitely be back.
What a dining experience!
Firstly I'd like to mention our waiter, Jake.
He provided phenomenal service and people could learn from him!
The food was outstanding.
The NY strip was a clear winner but everything we tried was a hit from steak, to drinks and dessert!
Sure it's expensive but you already know that going in.
You get what you pay for and it's worth it!
What a magnificent dinner!
Very classy place, and the service from everyone was prompt and excellent.
Caesar salad was very fresh and the dressing had awesome flavor.
The ribeye was cooked perfectly and every single bite was absolutely delicious.
I normally don't order dessert, but after the first few courses I had to see what was offered and decided to go with the coconut cream pie.
Underneath a giant pile of whipped cream was a tasty puck of coconutty goodness, and the accompanying butter cookie was a marvelous treat.
I'm usually quite disciplined when sticking to specific dietary restrictions, but everything here was so amazing that it was totally worth the calories to splurge.
Dined in for my birthday, the server was very nice and took very good care of us.
The food came out promptly and they offered me a complimentary small dessert sample.
It made me feel all warm and special.
You cannot go wrong with any of the food items.
I loved the lamb chops and crab cake.
My husband had the Tomahawk and it was great as well.
This place was neat, but didn't make the top of my list.
I really liked the atmosphere and the fancy chairs at the rail.
The food was good, but nothing magical.
However, the peach mimosa was *chefs kiss* Service was kind of slow.
I'd say it's a good spot to check out if you haven't been before.
Had a delicious dinner and the chef and sous chef were phenomenal.
Had great conversation and they made beautiful meals right in front of us.
Kitchen was clean and orderly.
We got the chicken Alfredo and a chicken Caesar salad.
The salad was huge and the Alfredo was a reasonable size.
At the end of the meal our server gave us a Christmas card and candy canes with the bill, it was very thoughtful!
It was the perfect date night meal on our middle of the week romantic getaway!
Very nice atmosphere inside the restaurant.
Nice booths to sit with big windows on one side .
Have good menu options.
The drinks were fantastic.
Taste wise it was good, not absolute best.
Same with service too.
Could have been a little faster.
There is a valet only garage right opposite where you can park for free for 1 hr.
Wouldn't mind going back again !
This place is always great.
This steak was so delicious !
And the clams are always a great appetizer.
The waiter didn‚Äôt know how to sidecar my drink properly.
I didn‚Äôt have the heart to correct him.
Oh well.
it was great since my date was allergic to gluten.
Going to a concert at Lumen.
Great location.
Very busy but only had to wait 15 minutes.
Staff was friendly.
Wanted to try their special but didn't have much time so ordered the Philly.
It was okay but I really don't know what a good Philly taste like üòû Wish they had more seafood options.
The shrimp appetizer was great!
Fries were great!
Great breakfast choices.
Hope I can come back and try them.
Delicious authentic French food in a charming atmosphere.
My friends came here before and wanted to come back after several years.
They were very happy to reaffirm the quality of their food.
I quite enjoyed it myself.
Next time, I'd like to try their dinner.
Anthony Bourdain had some very nice things to say about Le Pichet and he was absolutely right.
Simple, fresh ingredients prepared using time-honored cooking techniques make for excellent dishes.
My dinner at Le Pichet was the highlight of my week-long stay in Seattle and I consider myself fortunate to have had the experience.
I suggest making a reservation way in advance of your visit as the place is constantly busy.
Small French bistro at Pike Place Market is a jewel that never stops shining.
Mostly locals eat here, which makes it one of the last great restaurants you can get a seat at near the market.
Breakfast and lunch are first come first serve.
Reservations taken for dinner seating.
It's very small and intimate inside, but that's what I love.
If you go for breakfast note that there are only a few croissants made so grab them before all sold out.
I usually don't get there in time, so this last visit I ordered and ate 2!!
Worth skipping lunch and dinner for!
The staff is always great, so attentive.
So it's worth the 18% required gratuity.
Usually, I don't go to places that automatically add it to your bill because I think a "tip" is earned for above & beyond service.
I still think the restaurant and service industry needs to figure out how to pay their own employees' fair wage + insurance then leave "tip" to the discretion of the customer.
Why call it a "tip" if it's mandatory??!!!
Just raise your dish prices accordingly and leave tips to be earned for above and beyond service already.
This venue definitely brings a unique vibe to French dining.
The p√¢t√© was absolutely amazing and while the steak was delicious, the fries that came with it were way over salted.
The staff were not overly friendly and they also automatically included a 20% tip in the bill.
Adorable little spot near Pike Place Market.
The storefront is so small I nearly walked right by it, but overall I‚Äôm glad I stepped in.
The best part about my experience at Le Pichet wasn‚Äôt the food or my server.
It was what looked like the restaurant manager ‚Äî an extremely friendly woman who‚Äôs positivity was contagious.
She ushered me and my two giant luggage bags into the small cafe without hesitation.
The food (chef‚Äôs choice charcuterie plate, baguette, and bib salad) was fine, didn‚Äôt knock my socks off.
The dessert (a pear sorbet) was great.
I‚Äôd be interested in returning for dinner service.
Visiting Seattle while waiting for an Alaskan cruise.
Spent the day sightseeing and found this quiet underground Vietnamese restaurant that was an excellent choice.
The food was served promptly and the customer service experience was great.
There low popular music playing and the overall atmosphere was pleasant.
First time trying Vietnamese food, and my first time in Seattle.
I tried the Grilled Pork, Vermicelli, and eggroll.
Very yummy 9/10, and the people there are pretty friendly.
I would love to try again if I am ever on this side of the U.S. again.
Love this place!
I went there randomly because of my hotel where is closed.
But the pho there was amazing to enjoy!
Dont know why this place only got 3.9!
Personally i love this place!
Also the staff there is so nice üòõüòõ
Every time I come to the convention center I try to come here for lunch or dinner.
It's perfect.
I always have enough food to feel full, and the pho never leaves me with leftovers to schlepp.
Stopped in after a show at the Paramount hoping for quick service and good food.
We got both.
It was not busy and we were seated and our orders were in within ten minutes.
I opted for two appetizers and they were hot and just what wanted.
My wife had the pork and shrimp vermicelli.
She said it was very good but would have like the sauce that was served separately to be hotter.
Great service and we left satisfied.
Stopped by here today to get a fresh fish bowl.
The owner cashed me out and he was so nice and lovely to talk to.
The food was delicious and fresh..
I got so much fresh fish for the price ($17.50ish, i got the chef's special).
I was surprised with how much fish was in the bowl.
10/10 recommend and will definitely be going back.
Highly recommend
These bowls are so fresh and have a perfect balance of food.
I can see why it‚Äôs so highly rated.
The man who helped us was very nice and the food was done quickly.
This has been the highlight during my stay in Seattle!
Super affordable prices!
Amazing food quality and also being a big eater, the portions are huge and so satisfying.
They have Vegetarian options as well.
Love how the men√π is straight to the point, you are in and out within 5 minutes from your order if you decide to take-away.
Massive congratulations for whoever owns and runs the place!
Will come back ALWAYS whenever i'm staying in Seattle!
This place is exactly what it should be.
Loud and friendly Korean guy taking orders.
The line moves quickly at lunch time.
The food is simple but technically perfect.
Drinks are cheap.
Paying .75 for a bottle of water in downtown Seattle is just wild.
Great quantity of tasty food for the price.
Red Bowls is one of my go-to office lunch joints.
Food comes out quickly, and is always quality.
I enjoy the bulgogi bowls the most here but there are plenty of other options on the menu.
I usually get an egg on my bowls but avocado can be substituted.
Owner is friendly and service is excellent.
Most likely not the earliest Chinese restaurant in the area, but definitely the longest-running still in existence today!
Since 1935,  till now!
If you just came over from taking one of the guided tours at the Wing Luke museum --HIGHLY recommended-- you may have noticed that one of the restaurants mentioned was this place!
You walk in, and you're greeted right away.
Kind of a dark atmosphere, but still pretty well-lit.
Nice staff!
Clean!
Bruce Lee History Fact:  This was Bruce's favorite place to hit up with his friends and disciples.
He'd always order the Ë†îÊ≤πÁâõËÇâ(Oyster-sauce Beef) I heard.
So obviously, I had to get that too!
Also tried their Ê§íÈπΩËù¶ (Salt & Pepper Shrimp).
They used frozen shrimp instead of fresh shrimp with the shells and the head.
Different taste, but I don't have to peel away the parts with most of that flavor like the fresh ones.
Not bad!
Best of all, even though I didn't ask for the booth, there is a dedicated corner dedicated just for Bruce Lee, filled with his memorabilia and pictures on the wall.
Next time I come back, I'm asking to sit HERE!
It's not just a restaurant; it's a living testament to the cultural tapestry of Seattle.
Our family has been going here for over 20 years.
Great food, visit Bruce Lee's table he sat at and the wall of all the famous food critics visitors.
It's a restraunt set back in time well worth the visit.
The only place I can find legit fried rice WITH bean sprouts.
Tai Tung is a Seattle Chintown staple...celebrating 90 years in family business.
Bruce Lee used to eat here often, and his table is still there for group dinners!
You will find the food is traditional, flavorful and the staff are helpful.
This an old school Chinese restaurant with good food.
Their dishes taste authentic and were served nice and hot!
There are pictures of Bruce Lee in the restaurant.
Apparently, he frequently dined here, which was cool to find out.
Their hot and sour was the best.
This food was the freshest most delicious Chinese food I've had in a long while.
They also had my favorite dish, tomato beef chow mien, which I haven't been able to find in other areas.
The service was great even if they were short-staffed.
They had a busy restaurant and we still felt paid attention to.
The history inside this restaurant is amazing.
I highly recommend a visit to anyone in the area.
A landmark location in the center of Pike Place with beautiful views and friendly atmosphere, this restaurant should not be missed.
We've walked by this establishment for years and had no idea that there was a restaurant, so thank you Google, for helping with the discovery!
You will have to find parking on the street or in the numerous paid parking garages in the area and walk into Pike Place.
It is located near the fish market and the independent vendors that sell their wares.
They offer 3-floors of a dining experience, they can fill you in when you arrive.
We were greeted by a very friendly staff that very much enhanced the whole experience.
Food was tasty, with good seafood options.
My favorite was the soup that was warm and comforting on a rainy day.
Midas 5-stars for the views, atmosphere, and the soup.
The staff was very thoughtful.
I ordered an omelet without cheese.
She asked me if I have an allergy and told me what they could do to make my plate non-dairy.
The food tasted good and the view from the third floor was beautiful.
great food.
smoked salmon scramble amazing.
but better than the food was the staff, very welcoming, great attitude.
helpful, all smilesbb  super views from all three floors, second floor bar .
worth the 2,000 mile trip from Florida.
Breakfast on Friday morning about 830 am.
No waiting for a table.
Food was ready quickly.
We had a table on the second floor with a nice view of the Bay.
I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict.
It was delicious.
Maybe a bit on the pricey side, but that seems to be how Seattle is...
Best eggs benedict I've ever had!
I got the Dungeness crab benedict, so delish.
My friend got the corn beef hash, he really enjoyed it- I personally thought it wasn't salty enough and a lil bland.
Great views, great service, highly recommend.
Such a nice atmosphere to have a meal,  drink and catch a game on TV.
They provide room service to the Silver Cloud Hotel.
Everything was delicious from drinks to dinner to dessert.
We had the sweetest waitress.
We stopped in for breakfast at Jimmy's during a visit to the Seattle University neighborhood.
It was a terrific choice...the food was fantastic, served quickly but a very friendly and accomadating staff, and the ambiance is lovely (we sat next to the fireplace).
It is also very convenient that they offer free parking at the hotel.
The only downside is that there was garbage outside the hotel and restaurant.
It would be helpful if the hotel and restaurant "adopted" the sidewalks out front of their establishments.
That said, it is worth a return visit for sure.
We went here for the  Seattle Restaurant Week.
We booked a reservation ahead of the time and arrived the restaurant couple minutes early.
But the host did not show up for 5 or so minutes.
We thought it was gonna be a long night but our server was really attentive and helpful.
The food was surprisingly good despite it is in a hotel.
We over order the food.. by a lot.
The portion is a good amount.
Ended up boxing more than half of our food.
The server was very quick on boxing the and set them nicely in a bag.
Overall an enjoyable experience.
üòä
This is a tough one where I honestly struggled with how to rate it.
We had reservations with a large party on NYE.
Several of us arrived esrly and seated ourselves at the bar (which had ample open seating) to enjoy a drink until the rest of our party arrived.
We spoke to other patrons as well as the bartender but never even had our orders taken before our party arrived, and we moved to the dining area.
Our server was new and overwhelmed, and apparently, the restaurant was severely understaffed that evening.
It took some of our drinks over an hour to come out (many were incorrect or just misidentified) and some in our party never actually got the drinks they did order.
The food also took an exceptionally long time to arrive, with starters inexplicably coming either with or after some of the entrees.
Management appeared MIA, neither checking on their diners nor helping their waitstaff.
That said, the drinks that did arrive were, for the most part, really good (cannot recommend the 75 nor the watered down bourbon that should have been on the rocks but instead sat at the bar waiting to be served until long after the ice had melted) and the food was well received.
The ribeye and the chicken milanese were both very tasty.
If you're local and looking to try something off hours, the food is worth a try.
However, I would advise against coming on holidays or during peak times.
The food was pretty decent, the service was excellent, but the restaurant closed at 10pm and  half the chairs in the restaurant were upside down on the tables by 9:15.
At 9:25, when we were still seated waiting for the check, the work lights all came on even though there were still two tables with people at them.
Not the way to get people to come back, I certainly won't be.
Really great!
I noticed there wasn‚Äôt any photos of the masala I wanted add one.
Really was good.
Reminded me of a mango filled pastry.
I really enjoyed the Aloha tots and I don‚Äôt care for pork but this was really great.
Tots were crispy, red sauce is delicious, egg was cooked perfectly.
I would eat here again.
Give them a try.
I got the Luau with Beef Kalbi along with a Malasada.
Taste wise I did enjoy it, but I feel pretty ripped off by the price.
I went in expecting small portions from the reviews, but thought it would be okay for me since I usually eat less than the average person.
This was my dinner and I was still hungry afterwards despite spending $18!
Kind of ridiculous.
I wouldn't recommend for that alone.
The portion is enough for maybe a light lunch.
Doesn't hold a candle to the giant portions in Hawaii.
Some nice things - Prepared very quickly after placing order - Looked modern and clean inside - Malasada was okay.
I think it would hit the spot if you're really craving one.
I love it!
This was my first time trying Hawaiian food.
Their tacos were really juicy and the sauce was great.
Perfect value for money.
The only downside for dine in was that place is small; so I felt a bit Claustrophobic.
Highly recommend trying their tofu tacos!
I ordered some take out from here for lunch.
I ordered a taco each, kalbi beef n spicy pork.
They were aight, too dry and could use some sauce.
I also ordered some kalbi fried rice, which was very tasty.
The kimchi to rice ratio was perfect with right amount of kalbi.
Will come back here again but will order something else.
Heard their katsu burger n luau plates are good.
The place has a nice menu and definitely some good vibes.
With takeout, there always a risk that the place can screw your order while rushing thru peak hour orders.
For the price, the portion size was pretty small.
The food I got was tasty, and I gotta give props for the cooks for having gluten options.
Overall, I enjoyed my food, but I found the flavors quite basic.
They simply don‚Äôt have the depth or that something special that I couldn‚Äôt easily make at home.
206 Burger is where it is at...
This is the BEST Burger and more place I have ever eaten at... Their menu is so unique and everything is absolutely delicious...
If u want fish, chicken, beef, salad, fries, onion rings, they have such an amazing menu with so many different options to choose from.
The staff is always friendly and helpful and the owner himself is a hands down great guy...
I would highly recommend this as a stop if you are in the area...
This is a 5 star, must try, great experience, kinda place to go in Seattle!
Very good burger.
I'd def come back here.
Parking isn't great but if you get lucky you won't have to walk far.
Beware the menu prices listed online are incorrect.
We decided to get breakfast here as it‚Äôs right across the street from our hotel.
We got there at 9:10am and even though they open at 9am, all the doors were locked.
Someone eventually let us in and said they were open.
They have their menus on TV screens, none of which were turned on when we walked in, so he handed us a paper menu instead.
After ordering and paying I realized that I was overcharged $4 based on the menu prices.
When we questioned it, he said they just raised the prices and gave me back $2 in cash.
I suppose I appreciated the gesture but he had a chance to make it right and didn‚Äôt.
I didn‚Äôt care about the missing $2 but the higher prices are not listed anywhere and it makes me wonder if we were just overcharged because he saw that we‚Äôre tourists.
Our bacon egg and cheese and breakfast burrito tasted good and it‚Äôs the only reason I still gave three stars, but charging over $10 each for these items is ridiculous, especially when your menu doesn‚Äôt even match what you‚Äôre charging.
Clean, attractive exterior too, including colorful wall mural on adjacent mini-building on otherwise ignored parking lot side to north on mostly used for Virginia Mason, provide an enviable example for the rest of First Hill's drabness and the unsighliness of Capitol Hill, if not all of Seattle.
Good job.
I was roaming around the city and stumbled upon this hidden gem.
OMG!!
The burger Patty‚Äôs were juicy and season to perfection with quality ingredients.
I enjoyed ‚ÄúThe Storm‚Äù, really good, come check out the other creative names.
Now I didn‚Äôt have high expectations of the fries sense the burgers were so good, I thought the fries would suffer, but the fries hold their own spot light.
Some of the best fries I had in a while.
I would highly recommend this place.
When you go tell them ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù sent you!!
!
The atmosphere is inviting and the staff very welcoming and friendly.
I did not have to wait long for my order and it was the best lamb I've ever had.
Perfectly seasoned in the rice platter.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
It was also a great portion and another thing I liked is that the chef asked if I would like freshly squeezed lemonade instead of the limonata I ordered.
Nice touch.
The dessert was off the menu but deserves a mention.
Excellent chocolate cake!
Will definitely come back when visiting Seattle.
Truly the best falafel I have ever had in my life!
Hummus was amazing, along with the salad.
Coffee needs a little work (could be stronger).
Very quaint and the best Mediterranean food you will ever find!
The food was warm, flavorful, and made with care.
Everything was brought out quickly and perfectly presented.
The beet salad was completely worth the few extra dollars.
The atmosphere felt intimately friendly, everyone seemed to be enjoying each other and the servers were knowledgeable and cheerful.
The dolma was sweet with cinnamon, unlike most dolma I have had before, but very delicious.
The eggplant panini was lovely, perfect for a chilly day.
The portion sizes were just right.
The latte was not only adorable, but also had a delicious dark, full flavor.
The entire experience was perfection, and we felt very welcome to stay as long as we would like!
A great find for yummy kofte and Turkish meze.
Warm, cozy atmosphere and amazing service.
Will definitely come back soon.
What a fantastic meal!
The service was highly friendly and attentive at Cafe Paloma, and don't get me started on the food.
Everything was delicious and flavorful.
We ordered the Meze Platter to taste some of the delicious mezes and each of us got one falafel which rocked our worlds.
Pictured here is the Rice Dish with chicken that I would order a million times over!
Beautiful restaurant!
My friends and I had a nice brunch together.
I enjoyed the baked eggs and mimosa grapefruit.
The carrot cake is so delicious!!
Finding a parking spot near the restaurant is hard tho.
Very nice restaurant with a very good ambience.
Service is great and food is delicious.
Not very expensive and i would definitely recommend.
they take reservations beforehand, and we did make one.
We were running a bit late and they were kind enough to accommodate.
Sis is back in town and as always we are looking for interesting places to find our next meal.
Today we had brunch at Ben Paris located on the corner of Pike Street and 2nd Avenue as part of the State Hotel in downtown Seattle.
It was Halloween and the room and wait staff were appropriately adorned to fit the season!
We really enjoyed our meal, beginning with cocktails.
Both of us had drinks with the main ingredient being espresso.
My sister ordered a Calcifer, a warm drink, and I ordered an espresso martini, which I asked to be served over ice, with a side of cream.
(They did not charge me extra for the cream.)
Both drinks were excellent and I would not hesitate to order either again.
I ordered a half sandwich of a fig, bacon and blue cheese sandwich with a butternut squash soup.
I often find that butternut squash is prepared to play up the natural sweetness of the squash.
But this one was savory with a surprising and well balanced back kick of cayenne.
Really good!
Sis ordered The Fried Chicken Sando -- a crispy fried chicken sandwich with kimchee, fresno chili and pickled cucumber served on a brioche bun.
She requested that the side fries be kicked up a notch to the parmesan truffle fries.
The fries were our least favorite as the parmesan and truffles did not add much character.
With the fries we requested hot sauce and they brought us a collection of their house-mades - mild, medium and spicy.
Beware of the spicy, unless you are a chilihead.
I give Ben Paris high marks for character.
The place has an impressive bar and nice, comfortable decor.
The food is better than average good, as I found the entrees creative and well seasoned.
The staff is very attentive and willing to accommodate special requests.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to locals and out-of-towners alike.
Good value for a solidly good meal.
Amazing food!!
We got the smoked salmon omelette and ricotta pancakes.
The omelette was flavorful and the pancakes were nice and fluffy.
The mimosas were light and refreshing too.
Our waiter was very sweet and we had a great time!
We had a 7:30 show at Benaroya Hall about 2 blocks away.
Walked in for our 6pm reservation and saw 2 large groups.
Immediately knew we weren‚Äôt going to have dinner but we all tried our best.
The apps were delicious.
The drinks were excellent.
Justin was wonderful & gracious to us.
We will be back but without a time limit.
Finally a place I can come to eat some delicious fried rice and pork.
The food here is very savory and fresh.
They need to train the cooks in the Olympia area on how to properly make fried rice and cook pork.
I highly recommend this location.
If you find yourself in downtown Seattle hop on the 60 bus and exit on Jackson St in Chinatown-Internation District and walk over to Kau Kau.
They have amazing cheap lunch deals for $10.20.
I had half BBQ pork & Roasted Duck with the pork fried rice.
They had several options to choice from.
You beat the quality of the food and price near that area.
The staff was really friendly, please stop and support the family business.
A heads up they are not open on Mondys or Tuesdays
I love the Roasted Duck here.
It‚Äôs well-seasoned and the meat is juicy and soft.
We also had the triple seafood and vegetables, which was also very tastyyyy.
The price is resonance and the bill included 15% tip already.
Highly recommend and will come again üòä  2/17/24: came back for lunch with friends and still tasty üòã had Beijing Duck and BBQ Pork Fried Rice - all well-seasoned and yummy
I love Kau Kau's.
We have been doing BBQ Pork takeout for 20+ years.
Today was the first time we ate in the restaurant.
The food,  the servers,  the staff,  were fast, friendly and downright impressive.
I will have to make time now to eat there,  rather than just do take out.
How much time I have missed out on eating their wonderful food.
We enjoyed the Kau Kau's lunch special for two $34.99, and 2 pounds of chopped BBQ Pork to take home.
Busy, bustling atmosphere.
EXCELLENT food, service was good.
Really cool artwork on the walls, food is as authentic as I've ever had, the BBQ pork is their signature item.
Only criticism would be that this area of Seattle is pretty sketchy.
That's obviously not the restaraunts fault, though.
Let me start by saying that this restaurant is a hole in the wall type of place, so I am reviewing it based on what it is, not through the lens of the next big restaurant on the Seattle scene.
The food was delicious, hot, fast, and fresh.
I was craving pho on a cooler day and stopped in.
I couldn‚Äôt choose, so I went with the Saigon special pho, which was just all the types of beef - tendon, brisket, steak, meatball, and tripe.
I don‚Äôt prefer tripe so I asked them to hold it and it came out perfectly.
Occasionally in the past I‚Äôve asked for the same and other restaurants have just given me steak and brisket and left out the other meats.
I was pleased they left in the meatball and tendon (my favorite treat in pho).
I also ordered the tapioca shrimp cake per another review‚Äôs suggestion.
I‚Äôd never had them before but really like it.
When I ordered they asked if it was okay that it would take extra time, I didn‚Äôt mind because that means it‚Äôs fresh.
However, it did come after my pho, in case you‚Äôre looking for a pre-meal snack.
I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect so I will leave a detailed description in case you‚Äôd like to try as well.
The tapioca shrimp cakes are very chewy, almost like a long stuffed boba.
The filling is a mix of shrimp, pork, and some seasonings, and it‚Äôs served with a side of that light colored thin sauce often served at Vietnamese restaurants (sorry, I don‚Äôt know the name).
It‚Äôs also garnished with scallion and fried shallot (yum).
My initial bite i didn‚Äôt like because I felt it was too fishy and the textures were a bit new but by the time I got to the second cake, I was loving it.
I did add a little soy sauce which I think balanced it for my palette.
I do encourage you to try if you haven‚Äôt before, I found it delightful.
I also love chewy textures like boba and tendon, so do keep that in mind if you don‚Äôt.
Pho broth was delicious and hot.
Brisket and tendon was cooked well, meatball tasted good and standard compared to others I‚Äôve had.
The steak was slightly thicker than I prefer and it was well done, so I think they might cook it separately instead of pouring the broth over raw.
In any case it was still a delicious bowl.
Medium was a good amount for dinner and with the shrimp cakes it was more than enough.
I also LOVED that they served with plenty of basil.
I‚Äôm often served pho with decent broth, a lot of noodles, and minimal basil but this place had a very tasty rich broth, a good amount of meat, and enough basil for my taste (which I‚Äôd hard to do).
I would come again and i probably will.
Delicious!
P.S.
good chili oil at the table.
The owner is very friendly, and accommodating.
The food was great, with enough selection for me to choose.
It‚Äôs also pretty affordable
Stopped by for lunch and ordered the Tapioca Shrimp Cake and Saigon Special Pho (aka Beef Combination with all the meats including tripe and tendon).
The shrimp cake was sticky and chewy (in a good way) the way it should be.
If you want something new to try, I'd suggest that as an appetizer.
The Saigon Special Pho broth was very flavorful.
Full of aromatics.
The staff were welcoming and friendly.
I'd be back to try other dishes.
Really really delicious Pho.
I ordered the medium portion and that was more than enough for me.
The broth was full of flavor and meat was good quality.
I love the fact that they have all the different accompaniments available on the table, for me it‚Äôs important and shows the authenticity of the place.
I really enjoy eating here every time and will definitely eat there again next time I‚Äôm in Seattle.
We went in with high hopes when seeing some favorites on the menu.
Unfortunately the deep fried tofu doesn't look like the picture on the menu, didn't come with garlic or have garlic flavor at all, and seemed to have some breading on it that was similar to chicken nuggets.
The chicken bah mi lacked flavor and it was very hard to chew.
The chicken was tough and very dry.
The service did not make up for the food.
There was only two other tables in the place, and one was a single dinner, while we had two and another table had four.
We waited for someone to refill our waters and tea so that we could wash down the dry meal but no one came.
Eventually we gave up on the food and left.
Probably one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.
First of all, I like to thank my server/bartender, Richard, he was an absolute gem.
He made my entire experience wonderful.
The food and presentation is maculate.
The drinks were phenomenal.
The food and oysters are to die for and the desserts are beyond delicious.
Really appreciated the uniforms that the workers Dress in very nice of tire.
If I ever come back to visit Seattle.
I'm 100% definitely returning back to this place.
Absolutely loved the food and the oysters were fantastic!
Not to mention our waiter was amazing and gave great recommendations (sadly I never caught his name).
My favorite new oyster is the sun-seeker (one that was recommended and chosen for me).We ordered and within 15-20 minutes our food arrived and was so fresh and warm we had no complaints.
I do have to say if you go here that the Manila clams on the appetizer menu is fantastic.
Happy hour is a great time to go however it is packed!!!
The featured oysters were delicious.
I ordered all of the ones available, 8, and there was a list to keep track of what they were.
I also had the Elliots Vesper martini.
It was delicious and had a unique flavor.
The drink complemented the oysters nicely.
The large windows are great for looking out at the bay, even on a rainy day, it was gorgeous.
The staff is well dressed, have been trained in the ways of customer service and professional.
The whole atmosphere had a feeling of an upscale casual afternoon.
I would definitely recommend for oyster lovers.
I plan to go back to taste other me u items as well next time I am in Seattle.
I would have liked to see a bit of a gift shop... hats, shirts, etc.
I would have bought a light jacket or shell if available.
Great service!
Fresh seafood!
We really wanted to find a nice place and eat steamed Dungeness crab.
And Elliott‚Äôs can answer all of our wishes.
Nice selection of oysters.
The wait staff were really friendly.
The food took a bit long, the crab was understandable, but even for just oysters?
But other than that.
It‚Äôs a wonderful place!
Came here for dinner with mother and wife on a Saturday night.
We were really impressed by the quality of the dishes here, even though they were a bit in the pricey.
We ordered crab cakes, fried oysters, and mussels for appetizers.
We really loved the oysters if that is your thing.
But the grilled swordfish was the best!
It was cooked perfectly and the meat was actually a lot tender than I expected: I would highly recommend the swordfish!
We also ordered the grilled scallops which were super yummy too!
Overall it is a great place for a special occasion!
Food was absolutely delicious, took about 10-15 minutes to come out.
Mongolian Beef was extremely tender paired with flavorful veggies.
The Westlake Beef Soup was as warming as it was tasty.
Lastly, the Salt and Pepper Squid held the biggest suprise‚Äî served without sauce, though I would soon realize that it needed none.
Our server was polite and attentive, great experience.
A real gem of a Cantonese  cooking.
Food was really hot.
You can taste the ‚Äúwok hei‚Äù in the food.
Service was friendly and quick.
Definitely coming again.
Will also get take out here.
Authentic and delicious.
I had an absolutely fantastic experience at this Cantonese restaurant.
The food here is incredibly authentic and delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised by how affordable the prices were.
The chef's skills are truly amazing; and the service was excellent as well.
If you're looking for an authentic Cantonese dining experience without breaking the bank, I highly recommend this restaurant.
The combination of delicious food, affordable prices, and exceptional service make it a standout choice.
I'll definitely be returning to satisfy my cravings for their amazing dishes!
ÊØèÈÅìËèúÈÉΩÊòØÂäüÂ§´Ê¥ªÔºÅ
Eggplant and Cod Clay Pot, Pea Vine, XO sauce Rice Rolls were all pretty good!
A Chinese Restaurant that do tasty Chinese dishes that is beyond the typical Chinese American fare.
Look out specially for the stew pork and steam chicken dishes.
These has a more authentic Asian taste to the dishes.
If you thinking of ordering fish dishes you will need to order ahead.
I got the Country Fried Steak  I really liked that this meal came with a variety of different options The main attraction here was the steak, so I'll start there This probably was the weakest part of the dish, in my opinion.
There really wasn't as much crunchiness as I would've liked - as (partly due to the gravy) the breading seemed soggy and didn't seem like it was fried to a deep golden brown.
As far as the steak itself, I thought it was average - too well-done for my taste, and didn't really have anything too flavorful about it.
The gravy was decent, but again nothing special.
This country fried-steak was a bit of a letdown - also it was smaller than what I was expecting  However, a lot of the other sections of this meal combined to make the overall dish better The eggs were pretty solid - especially once I could put more salt and pepper on them.
Combining them with the steak definitely improved that experience The strongest part of the dish, in my opinion, were the diced potatoes.
They were warm, crispy, well-seasoned, and there was a lot of them.
Dipping these in the gravy resulted in something that was pretty solid.
I also found the biscuit to be pretty good - although I do wish the full thing was buttered and not just the top and bottom.
It was a lot bigger than I anticipated, which was pleasantly surprising.
Combining it with the jam resulted in something that really did taste very good.
My only complaint with the jam was that it was pretty hard to get it out of the cup  For the price (around 20 dollars) I think this was a pretty good amount of food that left me full but not overly so  Overall, the food was decent, but I'd like to get something else on the menu if I come here again.
7.75/10
I loved Ludi's!
The food was tasty and I loved the family owned business vibe.
Got a chance to talk to one of the staff who told us everyone there was related and their grandparents have owned this restaurant for decades.
Service was quick, food was yummy, and the place was clean and in a great location.
I got the Loco Moco which tasted good and was a good portion.
The ube pancakes are a must get.
My suggestion - share it with your party as a dessert!
Splitting them 3-5 ways is ideal honestly.
They're so delicious.
Only complaint is that price could be just a hair cheaper since it was pretty expensive ü•≤
We walked around trying to find a breakfast with indoor seating, and after a few locations, we found the gem of Seattle!
We were met with kindness, love, and treated like family!
You know, the ones you really love to see and look forward to seeing!
Those family members!
We literally stayed because the hostess (one of owners daughters), was so inviting and welcoming!
But let me tell you, the portions are amazing, the food is authentic Filipino with American Diner flare and the conversations Greg (The Owner) was just as fulfilling.
Greg's story is one of triumph, soro, and rebirth!
If you get a chance to speak with him, be prepared to be enlightened and ready to pay it forward!
The Silog Combo is a must try!
Greg and his family are absolutely amazing, and we look forward to returning!
Good food and good service.
We were looking for a breakfast spot and found this location.
I originally chose to eat here because i wanted to try their brioche french toast, but unfortunately when we got there they told us they didn‚Äôt have any.
So I settled for a pancake.
The pancake was delicious.
Customer service was good.
If you‚Äôre looking for a quick, clean place to eat breakfast I recommend you visit Ludi‚Äôs.
Place is so packed all morning, expect to wait.
Ube pancakes - amazing flavor, texture and fluffiness.
Ordering only them is a lot, I had leftovers.
Side of sausage and hot chocolate good too.
Staff super friendly.
Great music too!
FYI - setup so you order your food when a space has opened up, before you're seated.
Can't wait to visit again!
Absolutely delicious!
We came on our first night here and had to come back a few days later because it's just so good.
The soup dumplings are delicious and the wontons are to die for.
We all loved everything we ate!
Every dish I eat I think is my new favorite.
The bao we got were beautiful and so so good!
Definitely recommend very highly.
Great staff and service too.
Dough Zone has the best soup dumplings I have ever had in my entire life.
I loved their glass noodles as well.
The other chicken dumplings were amazing too and were very juicy on the inside.
The service was quite quick and the staff were really cordial and humble.
We had a great time and were lucky enough to grab a seat next to the road.
Happy tummy!
**TOURIST TRAP**  Do not let the locals fool you as they eat here too.
But this was not the best food I have ever had.
After a 45 minute wait, we were treated to tiny bowls of noodles at nearly $8 each and pot stickers that had little flavor.
It tasted like frozen pot stickers from Costco and thrown on a steam skillet.
Service was good.
Food and wait not worth it.
We were looking for somewhere that wasn‚Äôt too expensive and had small plates since we weren‚Äôt super hungry and it was our last night in Seattle.
We went on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, we put our name on the waitlist and got inside within 10 minutes.
I like the way they do their ordering, you basically just check the box next to whatever you want.
The food itself was pretty good and we enjoyed it.
The cucumber spirals were really good, I‚Äôve never had them before.
The prices aren‚Äôt overly expensive.
I enjoyed the experience overall.
We were able to get a table without a reservation, but we had to wait a bit.
No biggie - they were busy which was a good sign.
The food was all delicious - we ordered and shared six or so dishes - and was surprisingly affordable, particularly given the quality of food.
I think part of the affordable pricing is due to lower labor costs - the place runs really efficiently and not like a traditional restaurant.
Sort of like a hybrid of sit-down and takeout.
The only downside to the unique way they operate was some confusion tracking down a missing item we had ordered‚Ä¶ a minor inconvenience, though.
I‚Äôd be a regular if I lived in Seattle.
Not bad for an around-the-corner takeout Thai food.
The portions were big and taste pretty good.
We ordered the bamboo chicken and Singapore noodles.
Both were really good.
Incredible!
This is by far my favorite Thai food place in Seattle.
I work in International district and Thai Place has been my watering hole for over a year.
Their food is the freshest and most consistent tasting Thai food I‚Äôve had.
Their portions are great for the price and when you online order your food is ready very quickly.
Thanks!
(The picture is of my favorite dish, the Pad Kee Mao)
Food tasted great, spice level was accurate!
Pad Kee Mao was well cooked (there was wok hey).
Pork from the Holy Basil rice dish was tender.
they seemed to be short staffed (as indicated by signs at the store), may want to consider ordering online for less wait at the ordering counter.
Decent Thai food, but nothing extraordinary.
The crab rangoons are EXCELLENT.
But the Pad Thai and Wide Noodles in Peanut Sauce were just all right.
Didn't have enough sauce, kind of bland.
Also, the staff is really skimpy about the utensils, napkins, and sauce they provide.
For example, just 2 napkins for 3 entrees and 2 side dishes.
Ask for soy sauce and they give just one packet.
As much I liked the crab rangoons, I felt there should be more than 6 included for the $8 price tag.
Also, it would be nice if the workers were a little more friendly and generous with the utensils and sauce amounts.
Maybe add more flavor to the food as well.
But even so, this place was good enough for us to come back to a second time.
Pad Thai with 3 piece of chicken for $15?
That‚Äôs madness.
How could they took 15min to make this.
It supposed to be a fast food place.
The lady was not friendly either.
Will not come back to this place.
Good food.
Noodles were a little chewy.
Honey walnut shrimp was great.
We went into eat at a busy time.
Enjoyed lunch!
Was a little hard to use the app for the menu.
Hard to communicate and choose options.
Overall great!
Named one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown/Seattle.
There‚Äôs definitely a wait for this place and rightfully so.
The food is fresh, simple, authentic and the portions are huge!
The crispy pan fried shrimp, chives and sesame seed dumplings were delicious!
The roasted duck was equal parts juicy with the signature crispy skin.
The walnut shrimp was a surprising highlight to the meal.
Def would recommend.
Will come back next time I‚Äôm in the city.
Not our first visit, actually my boyfriend and his family have dined here for years.
The prices have increased without a doubt.
As someone with a shrimp allergy (don't judge), I was a bit disappointed with the majority of dim sum contains  shrimp.
Especially the pork shumai.
However, we tried several options e.g., calamari, parsley beef dumpling, spare.ribs, radish cake, rice donut dumpling, beef rool, mushroom rice flour crepe, sesame.ball, pork crispy bun, Chinese new year cake.
My dining partners (Asian foodie experts) give this place a 3.
Quality isn't as remarkable as it was in the par.
I was so excited about this place, and the food is really delicious.
HOWEVER, we brought leftovers home and found DEAD APHIDS (bugs) in our food!
Gross!
I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt wash the veggies before cooking.
ü§¢
More like 2.5 stars than 2.
Good dim sum but not great.
Decor has improved.
Pre-pandemic the dim sum was outstanding.
Now it seems that there is a new chef in town and quality is not the same.
Dim sum carts are long gone and ordering is through QR code.
Service is typical hit or miss Chinese restaurant attitude (friendly or grumpy).
It‚Äôs Chinatown so parking is tough.
Also there is ‚ÄúSERVICE FEE‚Äùof 3% to your order if paying by credit card.
No service fee for using debit card or cash.
Great food.
Something different than usual.
Great ambiance and service.
It's a small place but you can find some seats to sit relax and enjoy your food.
Delivery is fast.
Food tastes awesome.
I really liked this place.
The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the staff was really friendly.
I had the Oven-Roasted Chicken Bento, which is gf with the sweet chili sauce.
It was delicious and the price was reasonable.
Worth stopping in!
I had beef bento with extra beef, egg, and avocado.
Half the meat I paid an extra 8$ was just bone and tasted plain, so I had to add some sauce.
Also, they forgot to add an egg that I paid for.
I feel like for $27, lunch should be a lot better.
Fantastic food.
Every bite I said ‚Äúmmmm‚Äù.
I got the orange chicken bento box and my bf got the crispy chicken sandwich.
The flavors and textures of both were amazing .
We also loved the chicken dumplings and spring rolls!
We will be coming back for sure!
Such a cute spot.
Vegan bowl was delicious, but if you don‚Äôt like spicy I would ask for no sauce (They have soy sauce you can add yourself).
Place can get busy, dining area is decent size with small to large tables.
Service is fast and easy to get help.
Food is ok as what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, although portion size is a bit on the regular size as compared with other similar restaurants.
Parking is challenging and paid street parking.
Busy on a Saturday night, so make a reservation.
This Chinese food is substantial in portion, does not default come with rice, and quite savory.
In true (American) Chinese food style, there's not a lot in the way of light options.
Most dishes are cooked in oil (expected for stirfry) - not b stand out baked.
The meals can be family style.
There are several options for vegans/vegetarians as well as the pescatarians, omni and carnivores.
Dishes average $15 as of 1/6/24, but family style can easily get up to $30 pp.
Eh good service.
Full house on a Friday night - for good reason!
The soup dumplings alone are worth the twenty-thirty minute wait.
I recommend ordering family-style and sharing various dishes with your group.
As mentioned previously, I‚Äôd go just to eat soup dumplings but we also enjoyed the wings and walnut shrimp!
Overall 10/10 - will come back
One of the my favorite XLB spots in the Portland area.
The pricing is solid and the portions were solid.
The staff were a bit short but still very helpful with recommendations.
The food itself is well worth the stop in, so I highly recommend this spot and would even go again.
We ordered quite a variety of different items on the menu and genuinely none of it was good.
The egg drop soup was sweet, way too thick and didn't have green onions in it.
The orange chicken smelled nothing like orange and when tasting, it wasn't any better.
The honey walnut shrimp wasn't fried, it was slathered in a white, creamy sauce.
The chow mein didn't have any flavor and the wontons had an awful flavor, trying to be masked with salt.
We spent over $200 on our whole order and couldn't finish half of the things we got.
Most of it was thrown out.
I wouldn't even feed this to my dog
Very clean, nicely decorated, the servers were very attentive and nice, and the food was served quite quickly!
All the food was cooked thoroughly, seasoned well, and delicious üòã Slightly expensive per dish, majority are $20 a dish, but worth the price since the dishes are quite big portions.
Fried rice was delicious!
Fried well, all meat are cooked thoroughly and are delicious.
The honey walnut prawns were our favorite; crispy, battered well, and the sauce is sweet, though I wish they added a bit more of it.
Besides that, loved it!!
Sesame chicken was crispy and delicious, it's what you expect from a classic, a perfect dish.
We came here with anticipation as it's a Chinese restaurant we've been curious about for a while.
We tried the Chong Qing Hot Chicken, Seafood Fried Rice, and Golden Garlic Pork Spareribs.
The atmosphere in the restaurant, including the background music, felt more stylish and didn't have the typical Chinese restaurant vibe.
I had anticipated fusion cuisine, but to my surprise, all the dishes had an authentic Chinese taste, and the menu was extensive.
üò≤   They don't have a parking lot, so street parking is the only option, which can be inconvenient, but they were all delicious and we will come again and try the other dishes again.ü§§
We're not from Portland but found this place on a Google search.
It was 5 min from the hospital, perfect.
The place was clean, and the layout was nice.
We were seated right away.
The host was friendly and checked on us often.
The food was amazing.
Fried foods tasted fresh and clean.
Food actually looked like the advertised menu items.
We liked it so much that we ordered more to take home.
We're definitely going here again.
If you're ever in Portland and craving Chinese cuisine, give Tasty Corner Chinese Restaurant a try.
It's an absolutely phenomenal restaurant!
My husband and I went for the first time for lunch today, and we were quite impressed.
Their orange chicken was some of the best I think I've ever had the pleasure of trying.
I added broccoli and ordered a side of chicken fried rice.
The fried rice was tasty and cooked perfectly --- and fresh!
My husband ordered their crispy noodles with beef.
What an interesting dish, I have to say!
Delicious!
Don't sleep on their hot and sour soup or pot stickers, either.
Everything was so flavorful, service was excellent, and we have plenty of leftovers!
(Four star atmosphere, because they were playing a full playlist of Taylor Swift's early work and it made me cry.)
Very good experience and tasty/spicy Chinese food!
Will definitely come back to try other options on the menu!
Got the dumplings üî•, Mandarin chicken üî•, salty pepper fish (wish had more flavor/seasoning), hand shaven noodles üî•which are pretty spicy, and the Crab puffs üî•
Super tender chicken, refreshing greens with lovely refreshing lime dressing and all the Sauces are so flavorful.
I love the Smokin because it truly has that fresh off the grill flavor.
The best part is how sweet and warm the owners are.
This restaurant is a prime example of mom and pop shops that Portland is known for.
üëå
Great customer service and priced well, especially in this high inflation period.
Food tasted great and was served steaming hot.
Btw, the original sauce is actually hot.
I was not expecting that.
I couldn't bear that.
If you're not used to spice, go for the sweet!
I wish I had.
When keeping things simple goes right!
üëç
A small restaurant with a very limited menu, but it satisfied our hunger.
Didn‚Äôt know what to expect when we ordered Single Belizean Chicken for $11.
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt take a picture before I devoured my lunch.
Tasty chicken thigh and Belize rice.
Came with either a spring mix or arugula salad (I had the latter), and a separate container with a sauce for meat and rice, pickled onions, and lime juice.
The salad was tart with the lime juice, but I loved it that way.
I added some of the opinions to both the salad and rice, and used all of the sauce on rice and chicken.
Yum!
What a find!
Casually walking around downtown, we stumbled across some of the most delicious Caribbean food in the state!
Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior, the simple menu packs a significant punch.
If you don't know what to order, trust your server to point you in the right direction...chicken, red beans and rice is the go to!
Ordered the single chicken plate with arugula and original hot sauce, and I added a side of beans a la carte because I really wanted to try them.
Everything was delicious!
The hot sauce is actually hot, the arugula was all nice and fresh, the chicken thigh was tender and flavorful, and the beans were creamy and delicious.
I would've loved an option to have plain coconut rice, as that is what I miss most from Belize, and it's nice to get the coconut flavor separate from the beans.
This is a great, healthful option and very reasonably priced at $11 for a full meal; with $15 I can easily make two good meals.
The interior is quite casual, with a beautiful mural of a Mayan building on the wall, counter seating as well as a few tables, and two clean restrooms.
The staff were pleasant and personable, and I feel for them having to work in this place without A/C!
Because it's quite hot, they weren't offering their curry, but hopefully I can come back to try that some day.
I ordered the $10 burrito bowl.
I requested 1 each of the 3 salsas - habanero, red, green.
It came with the burrito filling in a bowl and 3 x small flour soft tacos.
It was absolutely delicious!
It came relatively quickly at about 10:00-10:15 AM.
I will absolutely be returning here as I live across the street and it is better than the other carts further up SW 4th Ave nearer the Chevron Station.
Super yummy!
The burritos are delicious and huge.
Great place for a cheap and quick eat.
They wrapped ours in halves when we asked for them split which was really nice.
I got taco platter and the chicken is soo grosss, the asada is chopped to ground beef.
Fantastic, was able to demolish 4 tacos in 10 minutes because they were so good.
Can‚Äôt beat the price either.
Parking can get a little tricky though but you can park in the garage they are in for 3$/hr
First time, simple order, carnitas burrito with no sour cream.
Walked back to work, first two bites were nice with decent carnitas.
Unfortunately the rest of the burrito had so much sour cream it should have been a "sour cream burrito".
Very unfortunate on a non-busy day that they couldn't get the order right.
We enjoyed five meals over New years weekend.
Breakfast veggie omelette (ask for micro greens to be added) amazing,  hash browns almost  as good as southern staple "Waffle house"  (IYKYK) ask them to add diced onions.
Sour dough is great (even though not baked in house).
Tried Chicken  and Waffles  (my first experience) the fried Chicken is epic and as  blows away most dedicated chicken places- even Chick-fil-A/Popeye's/etc.
Lunch/Happy Hour/Dinner:  Favs: King Tide Burger (hold the bacon add onions) - amazing  that a seafood location makes an amazing, mind blowing  burger (I think its better  than thier fish dishes).
The pi√®ce de r√©sistance are  the Truffle Fries with a Peruvian sauce made with pecorino, aji amarillo peppers.
It reminds me much of Baguio's garlic fried peanuts.
We never tired of these french fries at every meal (except breakfast :(  ).
We only eat fish we tried the Salmon and Alaskan Halibut  both were excellent  - but I would reorder the Halibut.
We had Ceaser  salad, garlic green beans, French onion soup and tried the house bread -(hard pass unless your Italian or are fond of Anise/licorice taste - the bread would have been amazing if the had substituted  Rosemary  for Anise (would probably  be amazing in a sourdough)- but I guess its a Peruvian thing (Chef Alex is from Peru)  and that's the only reason it stays on the menu - it was the only item we didn't  enjoy and wished we hadn't  ordered  it was disappointing- it looked so amazing-but disappointing taste.
Very disappointed.
The food took seriously so long to come out both the appetizer and the meal.
The only thing we received quickly was our bar service.
The calamari was typical.
The chowder was actually pretty good.
The halibut was egh but everything served with the halibut was not good.
For the cost my expectation was so much higher.
If the food is going to be lacking at least make up for it with exceptional service.
Absolutely hands up the most delicious dinner.
The calamari melted in your mouth.
We requested a second order of calamari.
I have had calamari from Oahu to the East Coast this is by far the best ever.
The clam spaghetti is fabulously delectable.
The merging of flavors is a fusion of perfection.
Thank you for my perfect Birthday dinner and a exquisite dessert
Very subpar service for our dinner.
Server didn't check in until 20 minutes after we were seated, she never introduced herself and couldn't be bothered to ask if we had any questions or preferences that she could help with.
There were almost no check-ins during our meal and we had to request a water refill after being ignored for half an hour.
We couldn't help but notice other customers seated after us were provided faster and better quality of service.
Perhaps being the only minorities in the dining room made the staff uncomfortable?
We were very polite and cordial but I've honestly had more friendly and attentive service at a McDonald's drive through let alone a restaurant.
The food was ok, not great.
My mushroom stir fry was almost all potato and just a very tiny amount of mushrooms.
We are here for dinner and breakfast while staying in hotel.
The bar area and restaurant are separate.
We ate In restaurant.
The octopus appetizer was fantastic!
Very tender and great flavor.
We sat outside for breakfast and service was a bit slow.
Jong Can's honey garlic chicken wings and house fried rice are delicious!
The wings were perfectly glazed, offering a delightful balance of sweetness and garlic zest.
Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the service provided was top-notch.
The staff went above and beyond, making the dining experience exceptional.
I wholeheartedly recommend Jong Can to anyone seeking fantastic food and excellent service!
Awesome place to have some Chinese food.
The food tastes great, and the hospitality is great.
Like being taken back to Changsha, Hunan!
I had the stir fried pork with peppers and it was a little different than Qing Jiao Chou Rou, but I could taste it's DNA!
The addition of cabbage was great, I didn't hate the bell peppers when I usually do and the spice and oil was less than what I remember from China, but they've turned it from a meat main designed for large family dining situation in a Chinese family restaurant into a complete meal for one and I just really enjoyed this place!
Don't sleep on it!
Feels pretty new and I am going to come back frequently!!
Honestly my only gripe is I wish there was a way to get a small side of their vegetables dishes to balance out my meal and that's such a small gripe.
I've never found a Chinese stir fry place in PDX that I loved before but this place was love at first bite!
Nice food and service.
Chicken chaw me in was perfect üëçüòã
I love this place....
So glad I found it.
I am kind of a creature of habit and always order the Black Pepper Chicken.
It is so delicious I think about it when I'm nowhere near the place.
Nice portion.
Super fresh and flavorful.
Always nice staff and reasonable prices make it a great lunch spot.
I just love it and want to make sure this place has enough business to stick around.
One tiny caveat...there are never more than one or two people working at once so if it is busy, waiting time can be a little long.
Since I only have a 30 minute lunch I have tried to call ahead and order, but that has never worked out as no one seems to answer the phone when I have tried this.
Not sure what's going on there, but the food is worth a bit of a wait.
Check it out!
Love the pastrami!
It was incredible.
A woman on the street just recommended me to get in.
She told about the pastrami and she was right.
It was excellent.
Very nice people too.
Yummy soup and sandwich!
Cornbread was delicious!
The help was ‚Äúsouper‚Äù helpful!
I got The Rachel and corn chowder!
Delicious!
Portions are huge!
üß°
Don‚Äôt walk too fast or you‚Äôll pass it.
Cool place I stumbled onto.
Bad signage great food.
Corn chowder tastes homemade to me and I‚Äôm a soup snob.
Cornbread OMG!
Pastrami sandwich dad would love.
Soups, salads and sandwiches.
Subway on steroids!
The service was great, kind atmosphere.
The aromas in the shop were appetizing,  but the chicken noodle soup was incredibly bland and disappointing.
Ingredients were quality but its as if they forgot to add any spices.
My only time there, not sure if this is normal for their soup, but I wasn't impressed.
The cornbread had more flavor than the soup...
Portland Kettle is a family run small business right in the business district of downtown Portland.
They serve a variety of delicious soups and sandwiches.
I ordered the sandwich combo which is a half sandwich and soup of your choosing.
The sandwich was delicious and savory and packed with pastrami, I was surprised it was considered a half, the chili is really good and was very filling.
The only downside is that it was a bit dry as if it was sitting for a bit, but delicious nonetheless.
This was a great lunch experience.
I ordered the chef's special to get a taste of the different seafood options and it did not disappoint.
My favorite was the tuna, but everything was great and cooked to perfection.
We sat outside which was very nice.
Service was fast and friendly.
This is a great place to meet up with a friend at lunch or take a customer.
My only complaint is that they aren't open for dinner so I can't go back tonight!
Will definitely return!
Gastro Mania has delicious food that is both elegant in its taste and ingredients, yet doesn‚Äôt break the bank.
Their Porchetta Sandwich and Salmon salad are so flavorful and really leaves a lasting impression.
Luckily I live close by so I can visit often to get my fix but I cannot stress enough how tasty and affordable their food is.
The BEST Mediterranean food hands down!
The lamb was extremely flavorful and nicely paired with the yellow rice and tzatziki sauce.
Great portion sizes for the cost.
Definitely must check them out if you're Portland!
If you‚Äôre in the area and hungry while reading this, I had the Beef Brisket Sandwich.
My experience was well beyond worth it for the price I paid.
Trust me - I love good food.
If you‚Äôre reading this to get more details about the Gastro Mania experience, let‚Äôs go.
I was leaving the Multnomah County Court House and it was well beyond the time I normally break my fast.
I asked some of the officers at the entrance where they like to eat good food that‚Äôs nearby (police know all the good spots).
One of them immediately said Gastro‚Äôs and the others chimed in supporting her claim.
Okay, Gastro‚Äôs it was.
As I approached the door, I noticed the hours of operation showed 3pm as the closing time - it was 2:37pm.
I‚Äôve worked in restaurants and I know how annoying it can be when someone strolls in 20 minutes before closing.
Normally I would find somewhere else to go, but today I was starving.
Upon entering the establishment, I quickly scanned for cleanliness as I walked toward the counter to order.
While the relief of the passing of the cleanliness test hit me, I was politely greeted.
I returned the politeness then proceeded to apologetically explain that I was aware of the closing time and understood if it was too late to provide service.
I asked if there was somewhere else she could recommend.
The polite lady smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe lamb is really good.‚Äù Right as she said that, the chef walked in and she asked him, ‚ÄúAre we still open?‚Äù In hindsight, I think she did this to prove a point.
He was just as polite as her and was even excited to prepare a meal.
I would now be able to have a meal and not feel the least bit guilty about it.
Let‚Äôs take a look at the menu.
The menu was quite robust, from what I could gather with a quick scan.
Let‚Äôs just say it was Mediterranean with some slight twists here and there (my apologies to the chef if this is too far off the mark).
I noticed something that I did not expect and with excitement in my voice I declared, ‚ÄúYou guys even have a brisket sandwich.‚Äù  There was a patron wearing shooting-range yellow aviators still eating at a table behind me (your shades were awesome).
He responded to my declaration before they could: ‚ÄúYes!
And it is amazing!‚Äù It was settled - I would try the Beef Brisket Sandwich.
I added fries, paid for it, poured some water, found a place to sit and eagerly waited for my brisket sandwich to arrive.
Maybe five minutes later the chef himself served the sandwich and fries.
I thanked him and took a moment to admire the craftsmanship - there was also a nice-looking salad on the plate.
If you‚Äôve read this far, you must not be hungry‚Ä¶that changes now.
Imagine that the last time you ate was more than 24 hours and your  next meal just appeared in front of you.
You can smell the freshness of the ingredients.
You smell warm bread, slow roasted brisket, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.
When I experienced these scents, my mouth immediately began to water.
Which is better: the first bite or the final bite?
I don‚Äôt know, but biting into this sandwich I swear it all just melted after a few chews.
The bread was warm, soft and had just enough texture to counter yet fuse with the perfectly melted cheese.
A little further into the bite came the grilled onions and mushrooms.
That slightly zesty, slightly sweet onion flavor merged with the charred nuttiness of grilled mushroom served as the bridge to the brisket - oh my, oh my that brisket.
I‚Äôve only ever had smoked brisket, but this brisket had no smoke whatsoever.
It didn‚Äôt matter.
I could tell it was slowly cooked by the way it melted.
The flavor of beef and fat married to the rest of the flavors is the best way I can describe it.
It was all deliciously balanced.
I‚Äôve never had an official Philly Cheesesteak, but I‚Äôve eaten some amazing cheesesteak sandwiches.
Gastro Mania‚Äôs Beef Brisket Sandwich has a feint resemblance to an amazing cheesesteak sandwich, but it stands head and shoulders above any I‚Äôve ever had.
I will be back to try more of the menu.
I love going here for lunch.
I work in a building across the street so having it so close is a huge plus!
Everything I have tried is delicious, but my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù is the chicken gyro plate or the salmon salad plus their hummus is very tasty.
Aside from the food being phenomenal, the staff is also attentive and friendly.
Alex is always super welcoming.
I highly recommend giving them a try.
Absolutely pathetic attempt at gyros.
I ordered a lamb gyro taziki sauce on the side.
The picture shows spit roasted and carved meat, tomato slices, onion slices and taziki sauce.
What got was a soppy mess of lettuce, chopped tomatoes, red cabbage, chopped cucumbers, no onions, smothered in hummus amd taziki, oh the cherry on top the meat was store bought pre-made slices that are barely edible and I don't think have any lamb.
Doest know what a gyro is meant to be, stay away and for the price ridiculous.
Oh and the 'fresh' fries had a microwaved and freezer burnt taste
Big shout-out to Cookie!
She's amazing, super warm and welcoming.
She made me an amazing chicken shawarma.
Plus my pup's loved the smells coming out of her kitchen.
Wouldn't hesitate to eat here again
Love this place!
One of the best carts in town for a quick lunch or a late evening dinner!
I usually get the lamb plate or falafel gyro, and you can‚Äôt beat it!
The prices are fair, the food is great, and the customer service is phenomenal!
Yesenia makes the best gyros in town and she‚Äôs super nice!
They treat my dog and me like family every time we show up, can‚Äôt beat a spot like this.
It was open late, which was good for a late flight coming in after checking into your hotel.
Food takes some time, so it‚Äôs not a place to expect fast food.
Falafel and chicken gyro are amazing.
Price is expected for its large size.
Maybe they could offer mini sized ones in the future.
This is my FAVE food cart in Portland and I make it there whenever possible, even though it's quite far for me.
Best Gyros in town, LOVE their spicy sauce and their baklava is pretty bomb too!
We always visit Schmizza before shows at the Keller - it‚Äôs just a short walk away!
Lots of delicious menu options and the prices are very reasonable.
Choose indoor or outdoor seating.
It can get a bit crowded inside but that just makes the experience more interesting!
I love their pasta Alfredo in all its forms, paired with a 22oz.
ice cold pilsner.
Whole pizzas or by the slice, sandwiches; so much to choose from.
Mmmmm‚Ä¶
Absolutely delicious pizza, very impressed by the size and price.
The Thai peanut wings were also exceptional.
Wanted the ‚Äúspaghetti meatball pizza‚Äù I saw online, apparently this location doesn‚Äôt offer it; they still made it but with chicken and I appreciated the accommodation.
Inside dining area was small and busy, sat outside and it took a minute to get noticed.
Service was friendly.
Had a "welcome to the neighborhood" coupon for a free 1 topping pizza.
Pizza was decent, however, my favorite is a 2 topping style but the bartender said no substitutes, to which I was willing to pay for.
Still, I had a medium pepperoni,  a side wedge salad, 5 piece mozzarella sticks and a peach hard cider which came to $16+ with the coupon.
The customer service is bad, the pizza is overpriced and undercooked.
They  had a special deal for Tuesday, yet they wouldn't honor it.
Go a block up to Pizza Jerk.
They are way better and actually honor their own specials.
This place is great to hang out with friends,  in summer the patio is really refreshing!üëçTheir pizza choices are amazing and staff is nice and friendly.
Slices are also cheap like 4.50 for solid sliceüçï Brandon is super cool!
Ps Sorry for scaring u lol
The person at the front counter never smiled or offered any assistance in choosing food.
I got the asian chicken take away salad and my adult son got the beef eater sandwich.
The chicken on the salad was so overcooked and dry I struggled to chew it and after the second bite I stopped eating it due to having a hard time swallowing it.
The salad dressing only tasted like ginger and the rest of the salad had little flavor.
For $18 the salad DID NOT meet even my barest expectations.
The beef eater had too much bread for the tiny ampunt of filling and since the bread was cold it completely started to fall apart.
The cheese was good but the rest of the meat and vegetables had little to no flavor.
For $15, would not order again.
Would not recommend the take away food at all.
The restaurant was a nice atmosphere and outside was nice until the wasps would not leave us alone.
If I come here again I will try the pizza.
Staff are easily overwhelmed by simple accomodations.
The food is expensive and poorly cooked in a place that should be more accessible.
instead of using a PA or calling out numbers they give you a piece of Ewaste to hold onto until your order is ready.
forgot my cheese.
best fries I've ever had
Decent food, nothing spectacular but good selection.
We had pizzas which were pretty good.
Need to order at least 2 to feed 1 adult and 2 teens.
Membership discounts are nice.
Best part is the views and they do have beers and cocktails.
Came here on a Tuesday to see the Marcel exhibit.
Got a membership so 10% off at Theory, but even without that it's legit prices for Portland.
Their cheeseburger tasted char broiled and had a great GF bun available.
Kids said the grilled cheese and pizza were great too.
Lastly, got a vegan Santa fe bowl, which was really hearty and filling.
Beautiful, relaxing atmosphere with tons of space.
Now that we're members we'll definitely come back and just chill in here while the kids explore.
Thanks for the great spot, OMSI!
Closes at 3pm.
We arrived at 2:45.
The three employees allowed me and my child to stand at the register for 10 minutes waiting and then walked up to me finally at 2:55 and said "if you're trying to order food, we're done for the day."
He did allow me to buy bottled  drinks.
Rang them up without speaking to me and then walked away without saying a word before I even paid.
Strange and very rude.
I have been going to Hawaiian Express for the last few years, for two good reasons: 1.
The owners are absolute gems 2.
The lunch special is tasty and extremely filling They have a good selection of Hawaiian dishes and drinks.
Highly recommend!
Auntie hooks it up!
Absolutely amazing.
Gluten free items are clearly labeled.
Everything was fresh and delicious.
The ribs and chicken with teriyaki taste like something homemade.
9.9/10.
I'll be back to check for spam musubi, 10/10 if that gets on the menu.
Wow this place is delicious.
A bonus is that they have all menu items clearly marked with what is gluten free and what is not.
Love it!
I‚Äôve gone here more than twice now and each time the food and been delicious and fresh.
Love the owners and the food!!
It‚Äôs owned by a husband and wife and most of my interaction has been with the wife and she is super kind and always asks about my day.
The husband also seems very nice.
The food is always super delicious.
I usually get tuna poke with Mac salad as a side and it never disappoints.
Definitely try this place if you‚Äôre looking for quality, tasty food, and it‚Äôs affordable, too!
Coming from a Small town Kansans I ate here 2 years ago, and now I'm back in town for a few days the owners are still so nice and kind and the food is delicious.
God Bless.
‚ù§Ô∏è
After a tram ride, under a bridge by a river!
It was so awesome.
The tacos were simple, were light but full-bodied, oozing with flavor!
Squeeze on both salsas!
The Margarita flight is an absolute MUST!
We loved searing hot steak fajitas on a cold winter day.
Absolutely delicious ü§§ IG yummy_food_travel
I used to love Cha.
One of my favorites.
But in the last few years, every time I go I‚Äôm disappointed.
Pretty bland.
They removed some of our favorites like pozole.
Just seems generic now.
But the thing I notice most is they use SO many onions it just makes it uneatable.
These tostadas were the same.
I found a few small pieces of steak, ate them, and this was what is left.
Loads and loads of onions.
Same with the guac.
Tons of onions.
Its all I can taste.
I‚Äôm just done with Cha I guess.
My friends said the same about their food.
I am so happy we finally went here.
Everything was delicious.
Salsa was homemade with a nice kick.
Fresh chips.
Tasty guac and carnitas.
My wife got a literal mug of margarita that she said was awesome.
Definitely recommend.
I ordered the mango lemonade & carne asada nachos for lunch.
It was good but nothing exceptional.
Stopped here for the first time today for lunch.
I ordered chicken and brown rice.
The service was friendly and very quick.
The meal had really good flavor and included good portions.
I recommend and will return.
Very excited to find a new quick place to stop when I'm downtown!
Great food, meat is grilled perfectly and teriyakiüç≤üçö is sweet but not too sweet üòã, the player is 8$, but it's all worth it.
They have yet sauces available in front to put some on once you get your food, or you can request little cups to get sauce to go.
Love this food cart, amazing amazing üëè üíØ
The chicken and rice with pot stickers is delicious and reasonably priced for good portion size.
Service is always quick and friendly too.
The chicken, rice, por stickers and salad is enough for a bite at lunch and some to take home for later!
Some of the best bang for buck food in the area.
Portions are generous.
I can barely finish the chicken and rice even when very hungry.
Guy working at the front is very kind and enthusiastic and always greets me with a smile.
If you need something to fill you up from empty and don‚Äôt feel like spending $15+, this is the go to.
Some of the best teriyaki I've ever had, Jimmy and his family are lovely!
Go eat at dosirak NOW
When it's cold outside, I tend to gravitate towards something soupy - the choice this time was pho.
This place isn't too far from the office, and I thought I would try them out.
What's nice is that they have a snack parking lot for customers (parking can be hard sometimes).
The decor is nice and simple, with the layout spread out.
I had the House Special pho (minus the tendon).
The bowl came out pretty quick and was at the right temperature.
The pho was decent, and the meats were tasty.
The server made sure that the water glass was filled at all times.
Overall, it's a decent spot to check out.
Great Pho with a variety of beefs to choose from.
The soup is slightly too weak for me, the noodle is perfectly cooked.
A great menu on a chilly day.
absolutely delicious!
I ordered the veggie pho with veggie broth and it was 1000/10.
we also got the brisket pho and it was phenomenal.
it was a cold day so this warm soup was perfect.
highly recommend this place!
Excellent lunch experience!
Tasty and neatly presented with good portion sizes, but not too big.
Service was helpful & friendly.
Bonus for the off street parking!
I had Lemongrass Chicken w/rice noodles.
This dish is satisfying for a warm day when the last thing you want is hot bowl soup.
Not the best pho.
The spring rolls were fine but  on the pricey side.
The pho itself was okay.
They didn‚Äôt give me any soy spice or siracha.
The greens that came with the food were old wilted and moldy.
The peanut sauce didn‚Äôt taste like peanut, it was on the sweeter side.
Overall experience was mediocre.
I‚Äôve been coming here for years, and it‚Äôs always so fresh and delicious!
The owners are great people who really put a lot of care and effort into their food.
They even remember my regular order which is impressive since they have so many different people coming in every day.
I plan on continuing to be a regular here and I‚Äôd definitely recommend it if you want something healthy, quick and tasty.
:)
Listen.
I‚Äôve been here a hand full of times and honestly I‚Äôve never been satisfied with the food quality.
I will say a couple of things though.
First of all, the people there are usually nice and kind.
Secondly, the price point is fairly reasonable.
Thirdly, this is like ok ‚Äúon the go food‚Äù.
Like the Safeway dishes are comparable to this place.
So if you want reasonably priced ‚Äúon the go‚Äù food with quick service then this is the place to be.
You get what you pay for.
Owners are honest hard workers and some of the best people you will ever meet!
They have been in the food/restaurant business for years and know their stuff!
Their previous restaurant was one of my favorite restaurants of all time since i was a teenager, and I've traveled and lived all over the world so I know my food!
Their new restaurant rice junkies is amazing and I congratulate them, wishing them new success with it!
Was very hungry stopped by here to get lunch payed alot more than I expected then thought the meal was good that's why, as I am opening it I saw the whole plate was covered in teriyaki sauce it was very salty too I thought they put it in a container on the side.
The rice seemed fake the Chicken not cooked all the way smothered in  teriyaki sauce with the fake rice and old veggies.
I wanted to go get a refund but I doubted they would give it.
Waste my money thrown the food in the trash.
This is hands down my favorite place to go in Portland for food.
Their noodles and vegetables are great and I love getting it with the chicken and a side of spicy peanut sauce which is VERY spicy and amazing.
Best caprese panini ever!!!!
It‚Äôs my go to sandwich and I‚Äôve tried them at a lot of places but have never been this blown away!
Loaded with arugula, pesto, and fresh mozz I am really amazed.
Plus the person working was so nice!
11/10
Great Italian food!
We got the Chicken Parmesan and Ham and Turkey and it was amazing with big portions.
Watched the chef make our food while waiting and you can tell that he cares for his food.
Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more!
The Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for and Angie is a sweetheart!
So I start out looking for Ray‚Äôs Kitchen the reviews are good, I‚Äôm famished, google guides me through the winding roads of Southwest Portland like a child on an adventure ride.
When I arrive at this row of slightly weathered food carts, Rays Kitchen is nowhere to be seen!
As cars rush by the closest thing I can find is Angie‚Äôs so I ask, where‚Äôs Ray‚Äôs and the lady up there in the cart says, ‚ÄúRay is my nephew, he don‚Äôt work here no more.‚Äù  And you know what?
It don‚Äôt make no difference.
Because the food is fantastic and Angie is a good sport and she treats this old geezer nicely, and the day ends ones on a happy note!
So there!
The Fettuccine Alfredo is Creamy and filling, the Garlic Bread is garlicky and perfect for sopping up the extra sauce!
I would have loved a table, but sitting in my car, with my dog staring fixedly at my food while watching the endless variety of Portland characters come and go from the various food carts more than made up for it.
Really, they should charge admission!
Keep your windows rolled down so you can visit with people.
Good food seems to make people make want to talk.
Gotta love it!
Food carts are dangerous.
A Whole Damned Rabbit Hole that could pull me into a never ending time and culinary time warp that I might not ever escape from.
I can feel the pull.
Best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had, and it‚Äôs for an amazing price that beats any sit down restaurant.
Ordered an ordinary panini with mozzarella, tomato, arugula,  pesto, all in a panini.
Didn‚Äôt realize how amazing angie‚Äôs pesto is compared to others, and the fresh mozz, and how everything combined so well, I went back immediately after eating to try his pasta, tried the fettuccine, which was immaculate.
Definitely coming back and showing this place off to everyone.
Real authentic food, new best place I‚Äôve had in a while, definitely a gem.
The fettuccine noodles were cooked to perfection, the sauce was the perfect amount of creamy and not heavy, and the bread that he serves is perfectly toasted.
Great Gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce!!
Great cart for when you want easy Italian.
Food was made to order.
My first Google Review because they don't have Yelp.
The owner said she will ask her husband to help make one as I usually write reviews on Yelp.
Anyways: great portion and food for the price you pay!
She makes it on the spot so it's piping hot!
The owner is kind, friendly, and remembers you even though she's busy or has a bunch of customers!
She offered free soup for us to try which was very kind.
We ordered: 1.
Mapo tofu (not too spicy, just a slight kick).
The tofu is organic!
2.We also got their shrimp rice noodle.
Fried nicely as it's hard to make it at home because it'll either stick or get mushy.
She cooked it perfectly!
3.
We also got green onion pancake beef roll.
That combination there is a MUST TRY!
Tender meat with egg inside the amazing green onion pancake.
4.
Egg rolls: cooked nicely, no oil on the plate, very crunchy!
It is just next to the Farmer's Market area, not hard to find and there are benches for you to sit and enjoy!
This chicken chow mein we just ordered here is horrific.
You boil some noodles and here is your chow mein.
Wow.
Never again.
Worst ever.
I convinced my daughter to eat at this cart.
I really feel bad.
We threw it away.
(Please compare it to the picture posted on the menu, really?)
Fried rice was really good, asked for medium spice and it was just want I wanted.
Spam musubi is really good too
Excellent food every time, plus they always remember to make my mapo tofu vegan ü•∞ I always eat every bite
Delicious, must try !
The owner is so kind and always remembers me & my order, she even gives out free soup sometimes with the order.
Amazing food and fair price üëç
I ordered an 18$ large poke bowl and I've never gotten such little food from a poke shop.
Why am I paying 20 dollars for one person, and I end up with 1 scoop of protein.
Never again.
Actually ridiculous
A better form of fast food.
The girls working were patient and service minded while building our poke bowls.
Tasty and satisfying.
Wonderful place to stop for a minute and refuel!
I was excited about the build your own options but the fish was just bad quality and nothing tasted fresh.
Cucumber salad tasted like it was made the day before which starts turning it into pickles which is not what I want in a cucumber salad.
This is my go to for a quick and satisfying lunch.
I love being able to customize the poke bowls and I feel like you get a lot of sides/toppings for the price.
I use the punch card and keep coming back for more!
The service was really kind and attentive.
But that‚Äôs kind of where the benefits of this place end.
Sanitation wise‚Äîdisgusting.
So many fruit flies.
A whole colony of them landed into my food upon opening the box.
The fish is not fresh.
They‚Äôre using the frozen Costco salmon hack while charging sashimi grade prices for the poke.
Really disappointed that this is considered one of the top poke spots in town.
