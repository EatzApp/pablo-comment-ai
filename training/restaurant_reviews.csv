Review;Label
Excellent food - my highlights were definitely the cheese grits as well as their pasta. The wings really great too, crunchy texture without being overly salty or greasy. Food is also reasonably priced for the quantity and quality for the Bay Area.;food
I'd recommend the Fried Catfish Cheesy Grits, everything was good though.;food
Excellent spot in the City if you're craving Soul Food!;food
Cool waiter with spot on recommendations.;service
My first time having legit soul food and I loved it. The pasta is incredible, the gumbo is smoky and savoury, but the highlight was the catfish and grits. The sweet and sour sauce went really well with the cheesy grits. Beignets were great; highly recommend the chocolate one. The banana bread pudding was also filling and delicious.;food
The atmosphere was also great, jazzy music and classy decor.;ambiance
good service;service
This is a very tasty place.;food
Everything I had feel fresh and well served.;food
The chef Salvador, was outstanding and great host.;food
At least they were real rice noodles and not bean sprout noodles.;food
It's so good and inexpensive. ;food
I always get the seafood fried rice which I don't think is even listed on the menu. And it's the best fried rice ever;food
Best Chinese food in town, one of my favorites anywhere. Seriously they could sell this for double or triple the price in a better neighborhood with a functioning dining room and call it 4-Star, and I’d still pay it.;food
Food was above par for this price point, but not mind blowing. This is a standby for a consistent, filling, tasty and economic meal among my friends.;food
The food is very very low quality even for the prices, they barely will give you any Meat at all, just avoid this place, is not worth your time or money;food
Service was a little slow.;service
Place has a old-style charm with a grand piano. I'm sure coming during a piano event is incredible;ambiance
I had a small Caesar Salad that was crisp and fresh.;food
Their manager, Sara was so accommodating - we were blown away by the excellent service;service
The owners and staff were friendly people.;service
Went last night and had a great dinner with the lovely piano man playing the piano;ambiance
This was quite possibly the best serviced meal I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating;service
Fortunately, we didn’t wait too long to get a table for two. The waiter who took our orders knew the menu well and made great suggestions. When I ordered my seafood pasta, he recommended less chili, which was perfect.;service
We came in during a Thursday pre-theatre rush hour. Unfortunately, we waited around 50 minutes for our mains.;service
The pizzas were tasty and we even got an extra pizza as they admitted making by mistake which was resolved after few extra minutes.;service
My partner's seared sesame-crusted tuna steak with gnocchi looked absolutely stunning, unfortunately wasn't medium as advertised but very well done and dry.;food
